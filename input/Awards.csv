This project also explores how models of industry engagement in Ph.D. students' educational pathways influence faculty members, including how faculty members shape their research priorities, mentorship practices, and grant-seeking behavior. By studying how industry-engaged models influence mentorship, collaboration, and long-term success, the project aims to uncover ways to improve graduate education for students knowing that the students' experiences should align with potential careers in both academia and industry. The findings will provide a blueprint for implementing scalable practices that reshape how universities support graduate students and foster stronger connections between academia and the workforce.

The project will use a mixed-methods research design to evaluate the effectiveness of industry-engaged flexible educational engagement models in STEM Ph.D. programs. It will focus on two key areas: mechanisms of support and graduate research environments. Researchers will collect quantitative data through surveys of students, faculty, and industry partners, examining variables such as career outcomes and research productivity. In-depth qualitative insights will be gathered through semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, including students, faculty mentors, industry collaborators, and university administrators. Longitudinal data from institutional records will track student progress and career trajectories over time. The study will seek to understand how industry engagement and other structures influence motivation, engagement, and success. In its first year, the project will focus on developing research instruments and the recruiting of participants. Data collection will span years two through four, with analysis and refinement occurring throughout. In the final year, the team will disseminate findings, release institutional policy recommendations, and evaluate the broader impacts of the work. Expected outcomes include evidence-based strategies for implementing sustainable, scalable industry-engagement models, improved understanding of how industry partnerships shape graduate education, and actionable insights for industry and career opportunities in STEM fields.

Culturally relevant practices have recently begun to be incorporated into secondary education; however, these practices may also be effective in addressing the gaps observed in STEM graduate education.   Previously funded work by the BSU/UMES/UMD Network evaluated how historically excluded populations at the Network institutions viewed the graduate school at UMD. The survey results from students, faculty, staff, alumni, and administration informed the focus and approach to be utilized in this project. The Community of Practice is designed to provide faculty who have expressed interest in working with the Network with an opportunity to adapt culturally relevant methods to teach and mentor historically excluded populations. Additionally, the proposed project intends to help student participants become familiar with graduate school opportunities at the various institutions, especially UMD, and engage them in necessary research training to ease their transition into graduate education in STEM fields.  This novel approach addresses disparities for historically excluded populations in STEM graduate education and has the potential to be adopted by other schools in Maryland and the nation. 

Culturally relevant pedagogy in STEM refers to approaches that incorporate diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives into teaching.  Culturally relevant pedagogy is supported by cultural awareness, cultural competence and cultural responsiveness of the educator.  This pedagogy has been introduced to secondary educators, postdoctoral students, and graduate students; however, graduate STEM faculty have had limited exposure. The goal of this proposal is to conduct four trainings in culturally relevant pedagogy for STEM faculty and implement an online mentor training program.  The training and mentoring program are intended vehicles in developing a Culturally Responsive Community of Practice.  The intended structure of the Culturally Responsive Community of Practice is to allow participants to share culturally responsive research opportunities and instructional strategies as well as facilitate continuous engagement among regional colleagues in similar fields.  The aim is to implement the culturally relevant practices in a 10-week summer research program held at the three partnering institutions for undergraduate students from historically excluded populations.  In addition to the 10-week summer research program, plans include each Network institution hosting professional development workshops for students, which will culminate in a joint symposium and students having the opportunity to travel and present their research, extending their connection with mentors and lab mates beyond the summer.  Project activities, including an instrumental case study approach employing mixed methods, are also designed to address the following research questions: 1) What is the impact of a cross-institutional culturally responsive Community of Practice on  cultural awareness, responsiveness, and competency among STEM faculty; and 2) What is the impact of a cross-institutional culturally responsive Community of Practice on interest in STEM research among undergraduate students from historically excluded populations.
 
This collaborative project is funded by the EDU Racial Equity in STEM Education activity, which is supported by the Directorate for STEM Education (EDU). This activity supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce. Awarded projects seek to center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by systemic inequities within the STEM enterprise. Programs across EDU contribute funds to the Racial Equity activity in recognition of the alignment of its projects with the collective research and development thrusts of the four divisions of the directorate.

Previously funded work by the BSU/UMES/UMD Network evaluated how historically excluded populations at the Network institutions viewed the graduate school at UMD. The survey results from students, faculty, staff, alumni, and administration informed the focus and approach to be utilized in this project. The Community of Practice is designed to provide faculty who have expressed interest in working with the Network with an opportunity to adapt culturally relevant methods to teach and mentor historically excluded populations. Additionally, the proposed project intends to help student participants become familiar with graduate school opportunities at the various institutions, especially UMD, and engage them in necessary research training to ease their transition into graduate education in STEM fields.  This novel approach addresses disparities for historically excluded populations in STEM graduate education and has the potential to be adopted by other schools in Maryland and the nation. 

Culturally relevant pedagogy in STEM refers to approaches that incorporate diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives into teaching.  Culturally relevant pedagogy is supported by cultural awareness, cultural competence and cultural responsiveness of the educator.  This pedagogy has been introduced to secondary educators, postdoctoral students, and graduate students; however, graduate STEM faculty have had limited exposure. The goal of this proposal is to conduct four trainings in culturally relevant pedagogy for STEM faculty and implement an online mentor training program.  The training and mentoring program are intended vehicles in developing a Culturally Responsive Community of Practice.  The intended structure of the Culturally Responsive Community of Practice is to allow participants to share culturally responsive research opportunities and instructional strategies as well as facilitate continuous engagement among regional colleagues in similar fields.  The aim is to implement the culturally relevant practices in a 10-week summer research program held at the three partnering institutions for undergraduate students from historically excluded populations.  In addition to the 10-week summer research program, plans include each Network institution hosting professional development workshops for students, which will culminate in a joint symposium and students having the opportunity to travel and present their research, extending their connection with mentors and lab mates beyond the summer.  Project activities, including an instrumental case study approach employing mixed methods, are also designed to address the following research questions: 1) What is the impact of a cross-institutional culturally responsive Community of Practice on  cultural awareness, responsiveness, and competency among STEM faculty; and 2) What is the impact of a cross-institutional culturally responsive Community of Practice on interest in STEM research among undergraduate students from historically excluded populations.

The latter concern has at its core a legacy of past research harms against minorities. To ensure the development of a culture of ethical and Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR), transparency along with consistent, timely and targeted training is paramount. To that end, Grambling State University, a Historically Black College or University, will implement a transformational Department of Research Ethics and Integrity program. This program will provide valuable instruction on what constitutes RCR as well as other researcher support and training activities that are responsive to the needs of a broad range of researchers. Research Ethics and Integrity program activities include experiential learning opportunities for faculty and their students, and educational resources for the research community at large.
 
The project aims to foster a culture of research integrity through providing essential training that develops RCR skills. The research team aims to discover: (1) whether a comprehensive slate of instruction and professional development activities and resources can promote ethical research practices; (2) what role RCR training plays in developing and fostering ethical behavior and knowledge; and (3) whether a comprehensive training program can have a transformational impact on an academic institution. In addition to exploring topics such as authorship and mentorship, research participants will be asked to examine case study scenarios and other exercises designed to stimulate critical thinking and reflection about ethical challenges that researchers confront. This project employs a mixed methods, participatory evaluation research design to determine the extent to which goals and outcomes are achieved. To evaluate the effects that training activities have on researcher perceptions of their ethical responsibilities, knowledge, and conduct, the team will collect and analyze quantitative data from surveys and other tools that assess and compare attitudes, behavior, values, and competency. Qualitative data will include faculty and student perceptions of the effectiveness and usefulness of the Research Ethics and Integrity program. This project will examine the research environment using the Institutional Research Culture Scale, determine if impacts resulting from ethical violations can be mediated with training through focus groups with community and university stakeholders, and serve as an exemplar of what can effectively create a culture of research ethics and integrity at similar institutions.

Both disciplines study how to make smart decisions, and their technologies have complementary strengths. Cross-fertilizing AI and OR technologies, as done in the research part of this project, has the potential to result in technology breakthroughs. However, integrating technologies from different disciplines is difficult, and different disciplines have different ideas about what constitutes a good solution (often due to disciplinary training). Therefore, this project provides graduate students with interdisciplinary training to prepare them for their research at the interface of AI/OR. Overall, it anticipates training a diverse cohort of 38 Ph.D. students, including 19  funded trainees, from computer science and operations research. Another 10 Ph.D. students and 15 Master’s students are expected to enroll in the AI/OR program courses each year. These students will be trained to work in interdisciplinary settings and have more tools available than their non-interdisciplinarily educated peers to create technology and systems for decision-making/support. The project will also make the created course material broadly available as a stepping stone toward introducing joint AI/OR Ph.D. degrees at USC and other universities.

The project creates a graduate specialization (in the form of a certificate program) for Ph.D. students enrolled in the computer science (CS) and industrial and systems engineering (ISE) departments of USC. The students will perform research at the interface of AI and OR while taking four graduate courses that teach a blend of AI and OR technologies (plus their applications to the design of decision-making/support tools) in an integrated and uniform way. Each course will integrate technical and ethics material (to prevent the many issues that have plagued the fielding of decision-making support systems in the past) and involve projects with use cases provided by several USC centers. The program will be supported by
workshops (that teach the students important non-technical skills such as communication, teamwork, equity and inclusion, team leadership, mentoring, project management, and entrepreneurship), a weekly seminar with research talks by the students and invited speakers, and an annual research showcase. Several components of the program will be designed to encourage interdisciplinary interactions among students and between students and faculty members to bridge the gap in research culture between AI and OR.

Black students in engineering programs often experience microaggressions, lack of support, and systemic barriers, which impede their academic success and well-being. This initiative aims to disrupt these cycles by equipping faculty with the tools and understanding necessary to be positioned to be actionable in cultivating a more inclusive and supportive environment. By focusing on the three phases of awareness, knowledge, capacity building, and community, the project will provide faculty with empirical data on the lived experiences of Black students, engage them in professional development to build cultural competence, and establish a supportive community of practice. This comprehensive approach not only seeks to improve the academic outcomes and mental health of Black engineering students but also serves as a model for fostering antiracist educational environments across disciplines and institutions. The anticipated outcomes include greater faculty awareness of racial inequities experienced by Black students, improved faculty-student rapport and relationship, and a reduction in the harm done to Black engineering graduate students. This project has the potential to advance social justice, contribute to a more equitable academic landscape, and inspire similar initiatives in other fields and institutions.

To address systemic racial inequities faced by Black engineering graduate students, this research is situated in the theory of racialized organizations and seeks to develop a comprehensive professional development program that increases faculty awareness of the unique challenges faced by Black scholars. Using a multimodal, mixed-method approach, the project will compare three educational modalities (e.g., case study, 2D-video, and immersive virtual reality simulations) to determine the most effective method for fostering faculty awareness and resonance of the lived experience of Black graduate scholars in engineering. Conducted with engineering faculty at Arizona State University (ASU) and George Mason University (GMU), cohorts will participate in the Positioning Faculty for Antiracist Orientations (PFAO) program anchored in the High Impact Cultural Competency framework. This program is designed to build cultural competency while establishing a supportive, longitudinal community of practice of Engineering faculty committed to racial equity. The project will leverage previous NSF funded work centering Black students as experts of their own experiences in applying their insights to inform the development of educational content. Over five years, the project will directly impact 90 engineering faculty, a novel and significant effort focused on the gatekeepers of engineering culture. The study's findings have potential implications for higher education, providing a model for capacity building and positioning antiracist orientations that can be adapted to support other minoritized groups. This work is supported by an interdisciplinary team and aims to contribute significantly to the fields of Engineering, Education, Psychology, and Computing.

By 2050, it is projected 7 out of 10 people will live in urban areas. The building sector accounts for nearly 40% of the primary energy use in the US and associated greenhouse gas emissions, with about half of that energy dedicated to heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting. Already a major contributor to climate change, cooling energy demand will significantly increase over the next decades. Urban heat stress is a growing concern. Thus, there is a pressing need to train convergent Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) professionals who can innovate and translate basic research into climate solutions. However, there are critical gaps in how students are trained to undertake discipline-centric research and to tackle societal issues. By establishing this Climate Action and Resilience for Extreme Urban Heat (CLIMATE-CARE) NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program, this project will pursue a convergent approach to training students with a range of scientific and educational backgrounds, in the fields of engineering, architectural designs, building energy and distributions, data-driven assessment, energy and sustainability, via nature-inspired solutions to mitigate extreme heat in an urban environment. The project expects to provide training opportunities to 36 doctoral (20 funded by NRT) and 20 master students as future leaders. 

The primary goals for this NRT will guide the training experience and practice. Goal 1), Trainees will demonstrate skill and expertise in convergent education and research related to topics of Sustainability Design & Engineering. Goal 2), Trainees will complete the interdisciplinary and foundational coursework for the planned Certificate program, which will prepare them with the foundation to carry out the planned research. Goal 3), Trainees will complete the Individualized Professional Development (IPD) elements required for the program, which will prepare them for the rapidly growing STEAM opportunities and careers in academia, industry, design firms, non-profit organizations, or startups after the degree completion.

Black students in engineering programs often experience microaggressions, lack of support, and systemic barriers, which impede their academic success and well-being. This initiative aims to disrupt these cycles by equipping faculty with the tools and understanding necessary to be positioned to be actionable in cultivating a more inclusive and supportive environment. By focusing on the three phases of awareness, knowledge, capacity building, and community, the project will provide faculty with empirical data on the lived experiences of Black students, engage them in professional development to build cultural competence, and establish a supportive community of practice. This comprehensive approach not only seeks to improve the academic outcomes and mental health of Black engineering students but also serves as a model for fostering antiracist educational environments across disciplines and institutions. The anticipated outcomes include greater faculty awareness of racial inequities experienced by Black students, improved faculty-student rapport and relationship, and a reduction in the harm done to Black engineering graduate students. This project has the potential to advance social justice, contribute to a more equitable academic landscape, and inspire similar initiatives in other fields and institutions.

To address systemic racial inequities faced by Black engineering graduate students, this research is situated in the theory of racialized organizations and seeks to develop a comprehensive professional development program that increases faculty awareness of the unique challenges faced by Black scholars. Using a multimodal, mixed-method approach, the project will compare three educational modalities (e.g., case study, 2D-video, and immersive virtual reality simulations) to determine the most effective method for fostering faculty awareness and resonance of the lived experience of Black graduate scholars in engineering. Conducted with engineering faculty at Arizona State University (ASU) and George Mason University (GMU), cohorts will participate in the Positioning Faculty for Antiracist Orientations (PFAO) program anchored in the High Impact Cultural Competency framework. This program is designed to build cultural competency while establishing a supportive, longitudinal community of practice of Engineering faculty committed to racial equity. The project will leverage previous NSF funded work centering Black students as experts of their own experiences in applying their insights to inform the development of educational content. Over five years, the project will directly impact 90 engineering faculty, a novel and significant effort focused on the gatekeepers of engineering culture. The study's findings have potential implications for higher education, providing a model for capacity building and positioning antiracist orientations that can be adapted to support other minoritized groups. This work is supported by an interdisciplinary team and aims to contribute significantly to the fields of Engineering, Education, Psychology, and Computing.

This collaborative project is funded by the EDU Racial Equity in STEM Education activity, which is supported by the Directorate for STEM Education (EDU). This activity supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce. Awarded projects seek to center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by systemic inequities within the STEM enterprise.

All of these devices rely on the availability of electricity and tiny chips that constitute the “brain” of the device. Critical to this technology is the availability of a trained workforce with the multidisciplinary skill set who are able to produce these tiny and complex machines as well as innovate new technologies. The microelectronics industries where chips are manufactured constantly update their products to take advantage of new materials with better properties and improved ways of fabricating them from raw feedstocks. There is a strong need to commercialize these products efficiently, sustainably and cheaply. Increasingly, this means incorporating machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) into the design and fabrication process. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Johns Hopkins and Morgan State Universities will prepare students fluent in both the science underpinning electronic device fabrication and AI, and thereby prepare them for the tens of thousands of new jobs that the microelectronics industry will need to fill over the next decade. Trainees will also become skilled in basic business principles to acquaint them with the skills they will need to understand supply chain concerns, make strong business cases for new designs, and learn to become entrepreneurs. Our program will also educate trainees to understand career options in this broad business sector and provide them with the skills to be able to communicate with and manage individuals, teams and investors. They will learn about the cutting edge of chip design and manufacturing, from next-generation materials capable of handling different environments and applications to quantum computers. Our efforts will be targeted towards creating opportunities for those who traditionally do not have access to such high-tech career options and help create mentoring relationships that last a lifetime.

The project team’s prior work (NSF #1409928 and #2100034), through a consortium study of ten universities, has found that for underrepresented minority (URM) faculty, promotion and tenure (P&T) processes function as a de facto gatekeeping mechanism preventing the equitable career progression of URM faculty. Specifically, URM faculty receive, on average, 7% more negative votes and are 44% less likely to receive a unanimous vote at the college-level, even when accounting for institution, discipline, scholarly output, and more. This grant aims to examine how, when, and why promotion and tenure decision-making processes disadvantage URM faculty and to create interventions to address systemic inequities that currently impact promotion and tenure decision-making for URM faculty. The current project intends to work, through a diverse PI team and through partnerships with URM faculty, to identify mechanisms driving systemic biases in academia. Ultimately this project, grounded in quantitative social science research, plans to 1) identify the mechanisms of bias in current decision-making processes within P&T committees that result in racial inequity, and 2) develop evidence-based interventions and policy recommendations that ultimately form resources for advancing racial equity in promotion and tenure decision making.

Using a consortium approach - led by three Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs, also designated as Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions [AANAPISI]) and one historically Black college or university (HBCU) - the Center for Equity in Faculty Advancement (CEFA) aims to address systemic bias and racial inequity in the P&T process. The intention is to accomplish aims through two phases. First, CEFA plans to determine the theoretical mechanisms leading to the higher likelihood of negative P&T outcomes for URM faculty in STEM disciplines, particularly URM women. Within this phase, the team intends to collect P&T data from five institutions, including voting outcomes, external review letter (ERL) data, and demographic make-up of P&T committees. Supplementing the P&T data, the team plans to distill other metrics related to scholarly output (e.g., citation and paper counts) from online repositories. Research questions include examining the role of diversity of P&T committees and departments, choice architecture, informal/formal P&T policies, P&T portfolios, COVID tenure clock extensions, and ERLs. The design is for the second phase to be guided by (a) insights from the first phase on the mechanisms perpetuating structural biases and (b) authentic partnerships - including collaborative workshops - with URM faculty within the consortium universities and national networks of URM faculty.  Specifically, phase two of the project aims to develop evidence-based interventions, including trainings and policy recommendations for each of the four key groups in the P&T process: 1) P&T Candidates, 2) P&T Committee Members, 3) External Review Letter Writers, and 4) University Policy Makers. Nationally available toolkits for targeting the full breadth of P&T stakeholders to reduce and eliminate structural biases and advance equity in P&T processes are anticipated project outputs.

This collaborative project is funded by the EDU Racial Equity in STEM Education activity, which is supported by the Directorate for STEM Education (EDU).

Advances in both fundamental and applied research have driven key innovations in plant science; however, fundamental discoveries in the lab rarely hold up under dynamic field conditions. Thus, they fall short of meeting the escalating demand for effective translatable solutions. The application of Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and other data-driven approaches to the wealth of data generated by fundamental and applied plant scientists offers potential solutions to this problem. However, cross-domain data analytics remain underutilized due to historical disciplinary silos that limit student training. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to North Carolina State University will, in partnership with Fayetteville State University, train twenty-one (21) doctoral students, including ten (10) NSF-funded trainees, at the convergence of plant science and AI to accelerate the translation of knowledge from lab to field to market.
 
The potential of AI and ML to facilitate translational plant science offers a fertile learning environment for transdisciplinary graduate training. Within this traineeship, collaborative graduate student cohort training approaches will be used, engaging diverse students from plant science, data and computer science, and engineering graduate programs. Cohorts will be challenged to complete user-inspired capstone research projects in partnership with local growers and cross-disciplinary faculty advisor teams over two years. These partnerships, facilitated by on-farm learning experiences, an interdisciplinary orientation boot camp, industry internships, and community outreach, will provide an immersive learning environment that enhances students’ abilities to identify and tackle real world challenges at the intersection of basic and applied plant science and AI. A convergent curriculum will increase student proficiency and core competency in these areas, while also educating students on the societal implications, impacts, concerns, and risks associated with applying AI and ML to agriculture. Research, teaching, and academic partnerships with minority serving institutions will enable the future development of a new bridge to the doctorate training program that increases the presence of those underrepresented in plant sciences and engineering. To address the grand challenge of sustainable agriculture and global food security, this training program will create a diverse, interdisciplinary workforce empowered to engage with industry, grower, and academic partners.

All of these devices rely on the availability of electricity and tiny chips that constitute the “brain” of the device. Critical to this technology is the availability of a trained workforce with the multidisciplinary skill set who are able to produce these tiny and complex machines as well as innovate new technologies. The microelectronics industries where chips are manufactured constantly update their products to take advantage of new materials with better properties and improved ways of fabricating them from raw feedstocks. There is a strong need to commercialize these products efficiently, sustainably and cheaply. Increasingly, this means incorporating machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) into the design and fabrication process. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Johns Hopkins and Morgan State Universities will prepare students fluent in both the science underpinning electronic device fabrication and AI, and thereby prepare them for the tens of thousands of new jobs that the microelectronics industry will need to fill over the next decade. Trainees will also become skilled in basic business principles to acquaint them with the skills they will need to understand supply chain concerns, make strong business cases for new designs, and learn to become entrepreneurs. Our program will also educate trainees to understand career options in this broad business sector and provide them with the skills to be able to communicate with and manage individuals, teams and investors. They will learn about the cutting edge of chip design and manufacturing, from next-generation materials capable of handling different environments and applications to quantum computers. Our efforts will be targeted towards creating opportunities for those who traditionally do not have access to such high-tech career options and help create mentoring relationships that last a lifetime.

As we near the limit of advances in microchip capacity and scaling, there is an imperative to become more creative with the use of new materials, new processing approaches, and new device designs to meet the insatiable need for continued performance growth. Recent Chips and Science Act legislation also stimulated new approaches to associated challenges in materials discovery and in the incorporation of new processes and device architectures. This training program will educate STEM graduate students to create the next generation of materials and devices driven by AI/ML integration. This innovative experiential educational program puts the student at the center of an individualized course of learning and career preparation. Trainees will be prepared to explore career options by acquiring customized skills needed for a specific career-focused track and will obtain path-distinguishing skills that will make them attractive hires. Their experiences include hands-on work in both physical and computational/AI labs; student training in funding oversight to teach leadership skills and ingenuity; presentation of a business plan to potential investors; participation in an internship at a venue relevant to their chosen track; intensive networking with domain experts; and exposure to career opportunities at annual interaction events.

To be part of this shared record, scientific works go through peer review by other scientists. Although peer review is intended to promote rigorous standards, it also has consequences for the scientific workforce - for who wants to stay and who is able to stay, in research-focused careers. Despite peer review’s place as a core scientific practice, learning how to engage with peer review is not explicitly taught. Few people receive training or oversight to ensure that reviewers provide feedback that is helpful, professional, and culturally sensitive (i.e., delivered in a way that does not marginalize underrepresented minority scholars). Graduate students’ experiences with peer review can influence whether they decide to stay in the STEM pathway. This project examines peer review with an eye to equity (are outcomes and processes equitable across groups), inclusion (does peer review offer experiences of fit and belonging across groups), and diversity (does peer review contribute to increasing the range of identities and experiences constituting the field). This NSF Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to Indiana University, Columbia University, and California State San Bernardino seeks to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion within science by improving peer review culture and graduate students’ ability to navigate peer review.
 
This project supports the innovative structure and goals of Reviewer Zero, a coalition of faculty and graduate students in psychology and neuroscience working to understand and intervene to increase equity in peer review processes. Reviewer Zero envisions a “reset” of peer review culture in which reviews serve a formative rather than gatekeeping function. This project will develop strategic programming with two audiences: the historically underrepresented graduate students most directly affected by inequitable systems of peer review, and the reviewers/editors who occupy positions of power in making peer review decisions. The project will design, deliver, and assess interventions that build awareness, knowledge, and support for each audience. Specifically, the project asks how targeting different aspects of the culture cycle can best shift peer review culture toward greater equity. By re-imagining ideas about what peer review is, the evidence-based training will engage individuals with new tools and supports, whether they are trainees or reviewers. A new paper development system (Formative And Interactive Review) will provide a novel institutional structure for fundamentally different interactions between reviewers and trainees. Outreach and partnerships with existing institutions (journals, societies) will lead to the dissemination of new views of the goals and processes of peer review. Towards these goals, this project will implement a comprehensive strategy to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in the peer review process by (a) working with reviewers/editors to shift culture and (b) providing direct support and training to graduate students navigating peer review. By studying how engaging with program activities affects trainee or reviewer/editor knowledge, skills, and abilities, the project will contribute to understanding how shifts in culture cycles occur.

The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.

MSU’s unmet research translation potential is an especially pressing concern given that it serves the low-population, historically under-resourced, and geographically isolated state of Montana. This Accelerating Research Translation project will work to overcome these hurdles and capitalize on the promise of translational activities and university-industry partnerships to advance STEM research capacities, infrastructure, pipelines, and workforce; spur economic development; and address diverse community needs in an under-served region of the United States. The project’s main goals are to 1) build on the university’s land-grant mission and culture of societal problem-solving with entrepreneurship and research translation as added core values; 2) increase research translation capacities through sustainable programs and support; and 3) elevate MSU’s levels of research translation in line with its very high research activity. By improving the rate of research translating to practice, and by broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in research translation, this project will contribute to improvements in economic competitiveness and societal well-being while sustaining research excellence at MSU. 

Expected outcomes, including a more diverse and energized community of students, staff, and researchers who value and pursue translational activities of direct benefit to society, will be accomplished via an integrated mix of innovative and inclusive training, support, and partnerships. A design thinking program will combine with an entrepreneurship curriculum to teach use-inspired approaches and co-produce culturally and geographically relevant translational research and solutions. A comprehensive suite of support will advance high-potential, high-impact research translation in the form of Seed Translational Research Projects (STRP) and encourage university spinout companies at greater rates. Local and regional partnerships with ART ambassadors and the University of Washington will promote research facilitation champions on campus, facilitate multi-institutional exchanges of ideas and best practices, provide mentorship, and allow access to well-established entrepreneurship and spinout services. These synergistic activities will be tailored to regional contexts and needs, and will prioritize inclusivity and diversity, with particular attention to Montana’s rural and Tribal communities.

To mitigate this bottleneck by bridging the gap between storage and computation, many innovative storage technologies have been introduced, along with near- and in-memory processing solutions designed for both emerging and traditional memory systems. Nonetheless, a considerable challenge remains: the prototyping and characterization of actual fabricated systems, especially those encompassing both mature technologies and cutting-edge technologies. To overcome this challenge, this project develops a cutting-edge Retunable and Reconfigurable Acceleration Platform (R3AP) based on emerging racetrack memory, leveraging a device-architecture-application co-design approach. The standout features of R3AP include its ability to function as a reconfigurable logic, a processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerator, and a high-density memory storage. It is retunable, meaning it can operate with bit-wise, integer, and floating-point precision, and can simulate analog-like storage and processing. R3AP effectively mitigates data movement inefficiencies while offering domain-specific acceleration and adaptability. With its dense, reliable, energy-efficient, and ultra-low latency computational capability, R3AP has the potential to revolutionize the storage and processing capabilities of future computing systems, such as those in Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). It can also be applied to high-performance and cloud computing systems. The project's findings are shared through publications, workshops, design contests, tutorials, industrial courses, and technology transfer activities. Educational resources and outreach activity plans are made available on the project website, and software artifacts are released on GitHub.

To realize R3AP, the project comprises a series of interrelated research tasks spanning multiple system layers. At the device level, the project integrates the voltage-controlled skyrmion motion mechanism with the industrial-grade 8-inch wafer magnetic tunneling junction stack and demonstrates a fully functional Skyrmion racetrack memory (SRTM), including the formation, shifting, and detection of the skyrmion stream. Additionally, it evaluates the performance of SRTM, focusing on aspects such as write-error-rate, shift-error-rate, read-error-rate, operation speed, and energy consumption. It also addresses and mitigates non-idealities, such as the pinning effect, and goes on to develop and demonstrate CMOS-integrated SRTM. On the architecture and circuit layers, the project involves the creation of a mutable lookup table, compute, and memory unit. This unit performs like multi-context Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) logic, parallel PIM logic, massively parallel accumulators, and analog-like storage and compute structures, leveraging the unique properties of SRTM. This layer ensures high-speed memory access from a hierarchy consisting of banks, subarrays, tiles, etc., and further adds links via configurable switch boxes and a mesh-based network-on-chip to enable data movement operations for PIM that would otherwise be challenging. At the application layer, the project develops novel modeling, analysis, design space exploration, and runtime adjustment techniques to exploit the high degree of reconfigurability provided by R3AP. The goal is to adapt future IoT and CPS applications to changing environments and requirements, optimize resource usage, withstand external disturbances, and enhance overall system performance, resilience, and sustainability. Across all these layers, the project develops a scalable computer-aided design (CAD) flow. This involves a multi-level intermediate representation-based compilation flow, which can compile high-level description languages such as PyTorch and C/C++ into binaries for the R3AP device. This flow uses a multi-level hierarchy including front-end, middle-end, and back-end compilation of the designs, and abstracts various optimization and management problems to a suitable level for efficient resolution.

However, many groups, such as Latinx/é and Black-Latinx/é, remain severely underrepresented in the discipline. Traditionally, students from underrepresented groups have felt pressure to assimilate because their own experiences are rarely legitimized neither in the classroom nor in the profession, resulting in missed opportunities for engineering and society to benefit from the creative insights these individuals can contribute. This leads to imperfect engineering design solutions with real-life consequences for those who are overlooked and for society at large. The education of engineers thus needs to explicitly incorporate the perspectives of students and their communities to pave the way for broadening notions of what it means to be an engineer and who can become one. All students have life experiences that they can build on as they learn engineering competencies. However, it is not yet well understood how exactly the learning process of developing connections between experiences and engineering works. This is particularly true for learners such as Black-Latinx/é who are often made invisible, overlooked, and rarely the center of engineering practice and research. Across three geographically and demographically diverse institutional contexts, this CAREER project will develop foundational understandings of how learners make connections between engineering practices and community practices (including language and culture) and will incorporate the lessons learned into developing a community-led pedagogical approach in engineering. The project will include learners from all races and ethnicities but also pay particular attention to Black-Latinx/é students. This project aligns with the Broadening Participation in Engineering program goal to transform learning environments for the participation and inclusion of traditionally underserved populations in STEM through research and collaborations.

This project will engage students in engineering thinking and practices (e.g., applying principles of engineering design) within three community-led courses. Students will learn ways of doing engineering as they engage in real-world examples inspired by the realities, histories and traditions of Afro-Latinx/é people. The work will draw on the rightful presence framework and theories of learning in engineering. Through three comparative case studies of institutions implementing a community-led engineering approach focused on Black-Latinx/é communities, this project will answer three sets of questions on community practices, students’ learning and identity development, as well as learning environments: (1) What kinds of language and cultural practices in Black-Latinx/é communities are associated with engineering practices? (2) What language and cultural practices do Black-Latinx/é students, and others of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, develop in community-led engineering courses? (3) What features and resources in the distinct learning environments influence the development of the rightful presence of Black-Latinx/é students in engineering and how these resources support learners? To answer these questions, the project will build on theories related to the roles that language and culture play in how people learn and analyze responses to surveys, interviews, observations and journal entries for each of the cases. The data will be analyzed using a variety of techniques, ranging from constant comparative approach from the grounded theory tradition to factor analysis and analysis of variance. Beyond the seven faculty members at participating institutions and 120 students directly engaging in the community-led engineering courses, the project will share the theoretical findings and design principles of the pedagogical approach with graduate students and the 300+ engineering faculty members at the partner universities, K-12 teachers, as well as the broader community. This dissemination intends to empower faculty and teachers across the country to adapt these ideas in creating learning environments for the rightful presence of Black-Latinx students and other groups who may not see themselves reflected in STEM.

However, there is shortage of trained workforce in the nation that is sufficiently qualified to develop and commercialize the resulting technologies. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Arkansas will provide a new, interdisciplinary, and sustainable educational experience in Two-Dimensional Quantum Materials and Devices (2D-QMaD) for STEM students through a holistic approach to graduate education of future scientists and engineers, including development of both technical knowledge and personal/professional “soft skills”. The project will train fifty-seven (57) masters and doctoral students, including twenty-seven (27) funded trainees. This will be in direct partnership between the University of Arkansas’s interdisciplinary Materials Science and Engineering (MSEN) graduate program and the MonArk Quantum Foundry (an NSF funded partnership between Montana State University and the University of Arkansas to develop a foundry-like environment for the development of 2D materials and devices.) This work inherently bridges the disciplines of MSEN, Physics, Electrical Engineering, as well as Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Engineering.

The unique guiding principles of this traineeship program can primarily be broken down into several key components.  These are: A) provision of professional practice and soft-skills training via the required seminar courses; B) creation and utilization of industry inspired cohorts and small teams led and mentored by upper-level doctoral students; and C) strong emphasis on education in entrepreneurship and commercialization of technology.  These professional skills are enhanced by D) a core and elective curriculum developed and taught by over 50 faculty from 11 supporting departments and three schools/colleges, with E) integrated research by the same faculty that feeds back into component A by lending material for practicing the soft-skills training.  The trainees will have the opportunity to learn and give feedback to widely varying research topics and individual points of view. The goal is to cultivate trainees who become the bridge between science, engineering, and entrepreneurship within the rapidly growing field of 2D quantum materials. The proposed curriculum for the trainees (including: quantum mechanics; quantum computing; quantum transport; materials characterization; and machine learning, in addition to the materials core courses) will facilitate research progress in the area of quantum materials and more specifically in 2D quantum materials, while giving the trainees the required skills to make future discoveries. This project will create a new permanent concentration of study, 2D-QMaD, within the MSEN graduate program.

The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor devices based on beta-phase gallium oxide offer the potential to achieve higher power switching performance/efficiency and lower manufacturing cost than today's wide bandgap electronic devices. However, one of the most critical challenges to the commercialization of this ultra-wide bandgap device technology is to overcome adverse thermal effects that impact the device performance and reliability. This project develops a university-industry-national laboratory partnership that ultimately leads to the formation of an ultra-wide bandgap device electro-thermal co-design center. The outcomes of this work facilitate the development a new class of kV-range gallium oxide power switching devices that will support existing and new applications that require high peak power, harsh environment operation, and low system size/weight; especially given the national shortage of semiconductor chips. The educational goal of this project is to create a multi-disciplinary educational model for university students and industry researchers that combines device and thermal engineering concepts, keeping abreast of current trends in these fields. This new interdisciplinary education model supports training a globally engaged workforce that realizes breakthroughs in the semiconductor device industry.

Technical Description: 
The research goal of this project is to create a gallium oxide device architecture with minimized thermal resistance realized by a bonding pad over active area approach and diamond-incorporated flip-chip integration. The principal investigators demonstrate the use of an electro-thermal co-design technique to realize a thermally aware device architecture that allows the full exploitation of the benefits offered by the ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor. A co-design modeling framework is developed that links energy conversion and electronic/thermal transport within ultra-wide bandgap electronics. This modeling framework helps identify the electrical and thermal design trade-offs at the material, device, and system levels. Novel laser-based pump-probe methods and optical/electrical thermography techniques are used to provide feedback to validate modeling results and improve the material synthesis and device integration processes. Since the proposed device integration method is material agnostic, it can be applied to existing wide bandgap and other emerging ultra-wide bandgap (e.g., aluminum gallium nitride) device technologies that are known to suffer from overheating and thermal instability.

However, they also identify a gap in current STEM graduate student training: curricula are designed to focus narrowly on the academic processes of discoveries with minimal exploration of their application to and development in the private sector, which is the purview of business graduates. Similarly, business graduates are well trained in their field but lack the scientific background to make informed decisions about the research direction of a potential company. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award will address this gap by developing a fully-integrated omics-business curriculum that will develop scientific knowledge alongside entrepreneurial skills. The convergent nature of this program will be based in interdisciplinary groups of faculty mentors and student teams that will work together from data collection and analysis to business design and development. The program anticipates the participation of 18 funded trainees and an additional 30 graduate students (Master and PhD). Undergraduate students will also be encouraged to participate in some of the activities that will be developed. Overall, approximately 100 students are expected to benefit from this NRT program.

The research theme of this Data Analytics in Multi-Omics Science (DAMOS) NRT program is investigating phenotypic variation using advanced genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics methodologies. “Phenotype” is any modification, whether macroscopic, microscopic, or molecular, that is correlated with changes in organismal fitness and survival. Genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics variability drives phenotypic alterations. Using the common language of data science and analytics, students in this program will design and develop projects that explore the full breadth of an “omics” pipeline, thus contributing to mapping genome to phenome relations. At the same time, they will capitalize on this knowledge to develop a business plan, practice business pitches, and network/intern with local industry partners to learn how to transform academic discoveries into solutions for some of society’s grand challenges. The focus on data science and data analytics will effectively create a new training paradigm that transcends the boundaries of individual disciplines to create a new generation of scientists who are equally comfortable diving into the details of their research as they are at exploring its potential business and societal impacts. Key elements of the DAMOS program include (i) a flexible curriculum that draws from three different disciplines (biology, mathematics and statistics, and business), (ii) modular workshops and experiential learning opportunities that integrate and expand on each student’s scientific and business background, and (iii) professional and career development opportunities to explore academic and industry career paths. All these elements are fully integrated within current graduate curricula at Oakland University and will provide a sustainable and scalable blueprint for this and future transdisciplinary programs.

Efforts to reduce the harm caused by fossil fuel energy generation include renewable technology solutions and policy changes. However, many solutions are expensive, and access to them is unequal. Low-income groups have historically spent a disproportionate amount of their income on energy and may face additional economic burden in the future due to uneven deployment of energy technologies and programs. Developing new clean energy solutions and finding low-cost and equitable ways to deliver them will require a workforce trained to innovate non-carbon energy solutions and integrate them with infrastructures and policies so that environmental, economic, and health benefits can be equitably shared. This future workforce will need to engage with communities to tailor energy solutions to address needs; communicate effectively with stakeholders from industry, policy organizations, and government agencies; and ensure awareness of the environmental, economic, and health implications of clean energy solutions among impacted communities. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Lehigh University will establish a program to train a new class of energy workers with the skills needed for developing and delivering clean, equitable energy solutions via interdisciplinary training in engineering, policy, economics, environmental science, data science, and population health. The project anticipates training 64 trainees, including 24 funded Ph.D. trainees and an additional 40 graduate students who will enroll in certificate programs and participate in research projects.

This NRT Program will innovate the training of Ph.D. and Master’s students through stakeholder engagement, equity considerations, and interdisciplinarity to pioneer impactful solutions while developing key skills for energy sector leadership in academia, industry, government agencies, and policy organizations. This will be accomplished through seven novel program pillars: (1) coursework on stakeholder engagement that culminates in an annual student-led stakeholder workshop; (2) a required course on ethics and equity in technology; (3) a multidisciplinary engineering, policy, environmental science, economics, and population health graduate coursework and certificate program; (4) participation in interdisciplinary research teams that target locally based but universally-relevant topics in equitable energy decarbonization and require thesis contributions connecting technology, policy, and stakeholders; (5) required stakeholder-based internships; (6) community building to amplify the project’s vision among a broader student population; and (7) professional development and leadership seminar series to introduce students to a wide range of roles in the energy sector. Program outcomes will be measured by the efficacy in meeting identified learning objectives, workforce preparedness of trainees, and ability to recruit and retain students and address workforce diversity in the energy sector.

Insects constitute three-quarters of the eight million animal and plant species on Earth. Insects play a critical role in human and ecological health, including supporting fruit set by plants through pollination, serving as food for wild animals such as birds, and facilitating nutrient cycling.  Insects are also key pests of plants and vectors of human and animal diseases.  Many insect species are showing dramatic and alarming changes in their abundance and distributions around the world, due to a complex suite of interacting factors.  Traditional approaches for monitoring insects are labor intensive and cannot be deployed at large scales.  Cyber-physical systems (CPS) to autonomously monitor, map and predict changes in insect abundance and distributions across landscapes and over time will dramatically improve our understanding of the drivers influencing biodiversity, while supporting communities and policymakers to make decisions that conserve beneficial species and mitigate impacts of pests.  This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to Penn State University establishes the INterdisciplinary Studies in Entomology, Computer Science and Technology NETwork (INSECT NET), empowering students to work across disciplines and collaborate with stakeholder groups to develop solutions to the insect biodiversity crisis.  A faculty team from 8 departments, spanning 3 colleges, will co-train and co-mentor 35 stipend-paid PhD trainees (25 NSF funded, 10 associates) and hundreds of additional students through curricular and program offerings.

INSECT NET is a transdisciplinary program integrating the life sciences, computer science, engineering, and data science, while leveraging advances in artificial intelligence.  INSECT NET’s unique solutions-driven approach - where collaborative student teams develop CPS to address stakeholder needs through coursework, internships and research projects - encourages creative and dynamic problem-solving, empowering students to readily adapt to new challenges, concepts, and teams.  Trainees will develop a growth mindset, a convergence mindset, and skills in team science. Trainees will gain competencies in (1) insect systematics (2) ecology (3) sensor design (4) energy efficient optimizations (5) continual learning and adaptation of AI systems (6) robotic systems (7) data integration (8) and data management, including designing visualization tools accessible to stakeholders.  Trainees will receive formal instruction in communicating science to diverse audiences (including the public and K-12 schools), project management, and best practices for convergence research.  Trainees will expand their professional skills and networks through internships, entrepreneurship programs, and engagement with our Stakeholder Advisory Board.  INSECT NET’s training opportunities will be formalized in a new Graduate Certificate in Technology and AI for Agricultural and Ecological Science at Penn State. INSECT NET’s unique recruitment pipeline will connect prospective students with current students and alumni, leveraging new and existing partnerships with Minority Serving Institutions.

In response, the University of Alabama (UA) has created the first MS and PhD concentrations in precision timing, incorporating courses in physics, engineering, and mathematics, developed through direct conversation with corporate and government partners. These conversations made clear that the field of precision time and frequency requires talent that can apply large-scale communication and negotiation skills across multiple STEM disciplines while considering business and national security interests as well. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award, the Alabama Collaborative for Contemporary Education in Precision Timing (ACCEPT), will develop an innovative graduate (MS, PhD) education model responsive to the unique needs for precision timing workforce development. ACCEPT will provide a  comprehensive training and educational opportunity for one hundred and sixty (160) MS and PhD students, including twenty-four (24) funded trainees from physics, mathematics, and electrical and computer engineering. Trainees will combine coursework across these three departments with professional development in critical areas identified by precision timing experts (teamwork, leadership, ethics, communication), and put their training into practice via research experiences with ACCEPT partners, student-led initiatives, and networking at conferences and workshops.

Precision timing (PT) is a highly interdisciplinary field that requires a wide range of academic and processional skillsets. Integrating them requires significant practical immersion that includes learning, practice, and growth experiences. The NRT program team will build a training program for versatile STEM professionals equipped to take on leadership roles in precision timing based on three pillars: 1) an interdisciplinary curriculum where foundational STEM courses lead to PT-focused courses blending hands-on technology immersion and discussion-based PT seminars; 2) holistic workforce development (professional, communication, scientific) with integrated application from day one, and 3) a sustained professional immersion experience for students to grow technical and workforce skills in realistic use-case scenarios. Trainees will build from a strong disciplinary foundation to successful interdisciplinary work while integrating real-world training and development. Trainees will learn to run a time service facility; analyze, investigate, and optimize time signals; and innovate to make clocks more robust, reliable, and compact. In parallel, they will gain the experience and skills necessary to communicate with stakeholders in business, government, and defense. This requires them to understand the importance of PT in our society, the importance of navigating the extensive interpersonal network that is the PT field, and to be ethically trained and grounded. The program will boost research and education infrastructure through the creation of a scalable, transferable template for interdisciplinary degree programs in PT. Academic departments nationally will benefit as the program is readily scalable and transferable to any STEM graduate program, with summative and formative evaluation approaches informing programmatic stability.

Extreme events such as hurricanes, flooding, drought, heatwaves, wildfires are escalating around the U.S. Machine-learning (ML) based Artificial-Intelligence (AI) approaches have shown great promise in reducing and responding to contaminated aquatic ecosystems and contributing to the sustainability of water resources. However, research in this area is fractionated in various disciplines (computer science, data science, AI, geosciences, biological science, and engineering). This delays the progress towards a better understanding of the impacts of extreme events, contaminated ecosystems, and ML/AI solutions. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to the Morgan State University will provide substantive, hands-on research experience for students who can tackle grand AI challenges using interdisciplinary methods. The traineeship will prepare 50 PhD students including 25 funded trainees from various fields (bioscience, computer science, civil engineering, mathematics, electrical and computer engineering) with technical, dynamic interdisciplinary and professional skills to responsibly solve grand challenges.

The traineeship program places a strong emphasis on a convergence research approach to AI/ML, aquatic ecosystems, and sustainability. Major research efforts will focus on three areas: a) AI for water reuse; b) emerging contaminants and ML/AI prediction; and c) disease ecology, weather events, and AI. The program consists of an interdisciplinary team of chemists, biological scientists, computer scientists, engineers to focus on research, educational, and career development activities. Over a five-year period, the career and scientific activities will include: a) mentored research thesis; b) advanced experimental courses; c) a series of professional workshops on leadership, scientific ethic, and science communication skills; d) domestic internship opportunities; e) summer workshops on potential solutions; and f) international research internships. Trainees will work in teams to solve real-world AI challenges, and a seminar with invited distinguished speakers and professional development activities will all help to foster a friendly and collaborative inclusive positive learning atmosphere. The outcome will be a cohort of students with a strong multidisciplinary background and understanding of how AI can provide solutions for water use, aquatic contamination, and water quality management.

Most egregious are the expensive, long development cycles and the sub-optimal design that waste resources and may adversely affect the environment and climate change. The fundamental cause of such gaps is the lack of detailed understanding of the influence of the material architecture, process methods, and parameters on material microstructure evolution and subsequently the end product’s physical, economic, and environmental performance. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT), harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) for Inverse Design Training in Advanced and Sustainable Composites (IDeAS), will train students through a physics-informed, AI-based modeling and design platform which will enable the discovery of new composites materials forms and relevant new manufacturing methodologies. This NRT award to Clemson University will catalyze a shift in the research and discovery pathway of the trainees via a transformative AI-age curriculum co-instructed by academic faculty and industry researchers. The IDeAS Composites program will train a total of 50 students; of these, 25 will be NRT-funded IDeAS fellows and the remaining 25 would be identified as IDeAS scholars. The program will draw trainees from computer science, data science, statistical science, mechanical engineering, automotive engineering, and materials science and will empower trainees with an academia–industry co-trained skill set that will ensure their success in the AI age. 

The research theme of this NRT program is focused on discovering and investigating the effectiveness of a physics-informed, machine-learning-based inverse design platform for developing new composite material architectures and manufacturing methodologies. The program will train a cohort of graduate students with deep, specialized expertise supported by broad, cross-skill knowledge, and equip them with a unique “DNA-shaped” skill set collaboratively facilitated by both academic and industry experts. Specifically, the program will (1) catalyze interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI and the inverse design of composites and manufacturing innovation via constructing a “digital life cycle” which is a suite of high-fidelity models for simulating a composite component’s life cycle, investigating the application of machine-learning methods for inverse composite material architecture and manufacturing process design, and developing an inverse design approach for integrated material and manufacturing design; (2) explore a combined graduate and undergraduate student training model comprising a composites inverse design capstone and a research design, development, and demonstration (RD&D) project centering on research outcomes applied to industry problems; (3) create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment fostering interdisciplinary collaboration in which trainees are prepared for careers requiring a unique “DNA-shaped” skill set; and (4) establish an interdisciplinary education program to (a) prepare next-generation composites engineering graduates (altogether 50 by year 5) who will have AI-enabled inverse design expertise and skills necessary to meet the unique challenges of the coming AI age and to thrive in the composites industry, and (b) train the current workforce to enhance their knowledge and foster dissemination of AI methods and principles in the composites engineering community.

By some estimates, nearly half of all occupations are at risk of being automated within the next two decades. At the same time, labor shortages within the U.S. have compromised post-pandemic recovery efforts and are particularly pronounced in occupational environments with high health and safety risks. Next-generation robots can address these challenges in industrial settings where the direct involvement of humans is either extremely hazardous, undesirable, or simply not feasible due to inherent barriers that limit accessibility. Educational programs are needed to provide scientists with both the technical knowledge for developing design solutions and the ethical understanding of issues related to deploying robotic technology responsibly to complement the skills of future workers. To address this need, this National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the Washington State University (WSU) will establish a multi-disciplinary approach to training future robotics scientists, practitioners, and entrepreneurs in the design, implementation, and implications of robotics applications within agricultural, nuclear, and underwater settings. The project will train 52 graduate students, including 21 NRT-funded trainees in Biological Systems Engineering, Psychology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Materials Science & Engineering.

Through convergent problem-based learning in leadership, entrepreneurship, and applied psychology coupled with a cutting-edge technical foundation in robotics and autonomous systems, this NRT program will produce leaders in interdisciplinary research and scholarship who are trained to evaluate the psychosocial implications of next-generation robotic technology for future workers. These objectives will be accomplished via: (i) multi-disciplinary research in the areas of: soft-, micro-, and bio-robots; autonomous systems; flexible electronics; biomimetic devices; and human-robot collaboration; (ii) professional skills training in the areas of entrepreneurship, leadership, supervised teaching, and the psychosocial impacts of next-generation robotic technology on affected employee populations; (iii) technical skills training via coursework, cross-disciplinary seminars, conference attendance, and biweekly research team meetings; and (iv) sustained community engagement by means of site visits, trainee internships, undergraduate mentoring, and an annual research workshop and exposition. NRT trainees will apply their skills beyond the classroom by participating in an immersive field study examining the user experience or market feasibility of next-generation robots in the areas of fruit orchard automation, nuclear waste cleanup, and underwater rescue/repair operations.

The parameter space for materials design is vast and multidimensional and is frequently guided by human intuition and experience. A fundamentally new research methodology is needed to meet societal needs in semiconductor, energy, biological, and manufacturing applications. The future of research will incorporate an increased reliance on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in the design, analysis, and execution of experiments, thereby changing the role of humans in the research process. While the ML and AI tools may accelerate research, they do not inherently generate understanding or create new applications. These uniquely human roles must be fostered and encouraged via creativity training – a topic absent in most graduate STEM curricula. This NRT award to University of Missouri- Columbia will prepare trainees for this future by integrating data science and analytics (DSA), evidence-based creativity, and cutting-edge materials training. The program will train sixty doctoral students, including thirty-six NRT-funded trainees.

Trainees in the NRT program will complete a rigorous DSA graduate certificate offered by the University of Missouri. As part of the NRT, a materials emphasis area will be added to the DSA program that emphasizes materials data curation, analysis, and evaluation. Major research areas for trainees include autonomous research systems to map complex synthesis-structure-property relationships, archeometry to investigate materials of the ancient world, optical metasurfaces, and amorphous interface engineering using advanced structural reconstruction techniques. Trainees will also learn to think creatively, to innovate, and to expand the societal impact of materials research using an evidence-based creativity training curriculum. The creativity training will be formally integrated into the research plan and dissertation of each trainee. The NRT trainees and faculty will facilitate a culture of respect and trust by promoting new ideas, accepting failures, and encouraging risk taking. Biweekly Café Hours, annual outings, and outreach activities will foster a welcoming and informal environment while building a community of practice.

While the quantum photonics field is growing rapidly, graduate trainees in this field are still educated within the framework of traditional academic departments. This NSF Research Traineeship award to the University of New Mexico (UNM) will address the need for cross-disciplinary graduate training in quantum photonics for students with diverse undergraduate backgrounds. The program will prepare 175 students, including 25 funded trainees, to become generalists in quantum technologies hardware. The tools and academic training provided will prepare trainees for a wide variety of careers in semiconductor and quantum technologies.

Quantum Photonics interdisciplinary training to Advance Quantum Technologies (QPAQT) will be led by a faculty team whose research interests are at the intersection between photonic science and quantum technology, with an emphasis on semiconductor and atomic, molecular, and optical physics device platforms. These research areas include quantum sensing, quantum networks, nonlinear quantum photonics, integrated photonics, and molecular qubits. The team will have representation from the Electrical Engineering, Physics, and Chemistry departments and interdisciplinary units including the Center for High Technology Materials and Center for Quantum Information & Control. This project leverages UNM’s connections to national labs and semiconductor fabrication facilities near the university to prepare the trainees as the future workforce in semiconductor and quantum technologies. As a flagship university in a state with a unique demographic profile, this program has a great potential to broaden participation. QPAQT’s four primary goals are: 1) professional development: trainees will develop an identity as quantum photonics researchers and effectively operate within the professional community; 2) academic achievement: trainees will acquire a broad base of knowledge, perform original research, and develop the skills needed to find employment in quantum photonics; 3) recruitment and retention from groups that are historically underserved: more than 50% of trainees will be women and/or races and ethnicities that are historically underserved; 4) program sustainability: QPAQT will operate effectively across departments and colleges and will be widely disseminated to the academic community. Key training elements will include an interdisciplinary quantum photonics curriculum, individualized internal and external trainee mentorship, research rotations, internships at industry and national lab partners, a weekly professional development seminar, and peer mentorship in undergraduate outreach programs.

This program will be one of a few in the U.S. that is not housed in a traditional academic department, but rather spans various participating departments including physics, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, and materials science. A new graduate-level curriculum will be developed using vetted principles from educational research. The curriculum will feature a compact common core of QISE courses supplemented by graduate modules to accommodate variations in trainee preparation from these disciplines. In addition to courses, NRT trainees will be engaged in QISE research from the start, and will develop professional skills in ethics, technical writing and communication. They will also benefit from graduate-level industry internships. The program will directly fund 25 trainees over the award period, with 10-20 additional degree students funded from other sources, and 100+ students benefiting from taking courses as electives. The program will make societal impacts through cutting edge research in QISE, national engagement, and training of a diverse workforce in semiconductor and quantum technologies.  

This new NRT program will embed principles highlighted in the National Quantum Workforce Strategic Plan including distributed and modular course content to accommodate diverse pathways into and through the program, an expedited transition from courses to experiential learning, and evidenced-based and inclusive course development using ‘Backward Design’ principles. NRT trainees will expand the QISE research in areas such as hybrid quantum systems, novel qubits based on molecules, semiconductor materials and technologies, and integrated photonics for quantum networks. The OSU team is a leader in studying how the properties of defects in semiconductors depend on, and can be tuned by, the local environment, including proximity to other defects, interfaces and electromagnetic fields. Overall, the goals of this program are to: 1) create a proposal for developing a proposal for Master’s and PhD degrees in QISE at The OSU; 2) develop and deliver three core graduate courses: Foundations in QISE, Grand Challenges in QISE, and Classical vs. Quantum Computing, as well as two interdisciplinary graduate elective courses in QISE; 3) evaluate program impact and iterate to continuously improve student outcomes; 4) build on industry partnerships to develop graduate internships, sponsored research projects, and certificate programs; and 5) develop a long-term, sustainable model for graduate research and traineeship in QISE for long-term impact.

This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of California, Berkeley will develop novel interventions to reduce inequities and their resulting harms  in criminal legal systems.  New scientific knowledge will be generated through the development of tools for large-scale, ""human-in-the-loop"" analysis of criminal justice data, and will be used in the generation of new insights regarding legal system processes, impacts, and institutions. Faculty and trainees will collaborate across disciplines to simultaneously address social-science and policy questions regarding equity and criminal legal institutions, the development of tools and methods for leveraging newly available data from the criminal legal system, and ethical and social implications of big data and AI in the context of criminal justice. This NRT will train a new generation of researchers interested in computational approaches to equity and legal systems, enabling them to develop and evaluate public policy solutions that can mitigate social and economic polarization. It will also train a diverse workforce with flexible and transferrable computational skills, while also training social and data scientists in ethical AI and its social implications. It will create a transformative, cross-disciplinary model for graduate training at Berkeley and elsewhere, while also developing a broad-based recruiting and mentoring program to enhance training of students from underrepresented groups, which, in turn, helps to diversify the STEM workforce. The project anticipates training 50 PhD students, including 25 funded trainees, from the Social Sciences, Computer Science, and Statistics.  

Recent public and policy interest in the criminal legal system coupled with new government efforts to make data public and leverage data for public policy creates new opportunities to study the criminal legal system, but only if such data can be made ready for analysis. The criminal legal system is critical terrain for evaluating how pervasive data collection and algorithmic decision-making can be brought into the service of society, while addressing potent challenges that can accompany these approaches. Big data and AI can give us broader and more precise knowledge of the dynamics of social systems and hold potential to increase transparency and support fairer decision-making. At the same time, areas relating to criminal justice have seen a massive expansion of surveillance, data production and reuse, and algorithmic decision-making often without oversight, recourse, or evidence about effectiveness in addressing underlying issues. Data technologies in criminal justice have grounded new social schema of classification and accompanying social hierarchies – from recidivism risk scores to predictive policing – with important implications for opportunity and life chances. Our goal is to develop tools for continuous ingestion, integration, and cleaning of structured and unstructured data, and the analysis of such data. Using a combination of large pre-trained AI models coupled with data management and human-computer interaction techniques, we will develop tools to ingest information from various government and online sources, turning it into structured data for analysis. These efforts will lead to novel and generalizable tools for semi-autonomous and continuous data processing, as well as integration at scale, that also preserves privacy and promotes equity.

These flexible systems can facilitate many advances in critical areas such as preventive medicine, environmental monitoring, low-cost supply-chain management, or smart packaging. We have also been able to utilize compact logic controller chips, so-called edge-computing elements, that can be thinned down and included in such devices and systems to take advantage of signal processing and wireless connectivity. The next generation of these smart wearable systems must now develop an ability to incorporate specialized low-power and reconfigurable logic elements that can harness the full power of machine-learning and artificial intelligence. Known as neuromorphic computing elements and neural accelerators, these added computational elements can lessen the load edge-computing will face when billions of these wearable elements could overload the networks and cloud computing, each demanding to run neural inferences otherwise remotely. Here, we propose to explore and develop threshold logic gates (TLGs) that can be utilized to build such neural circuitry for flexible electronics. Using our expertise in metal-oxide (MOx) thin-film transistors (TFTs) and logic circuit design, we will explore novel TLGs that will implement reconfigurable, secure and ultra-compact neuromorphic computing elements that can address the impending bottleneck in truly revolutionary wearable electronics of the next decade. The added benefit of working with flexible electronics is its unique potential to serve as an accessible and ‘flexible’ technology platform to learn, explore and test integrated devices and systems. Since such integral experiences are no longer affordable or practical at the undergraduate level within state-of-the-art semiconductor engineering, flexible electronics can become a true enabler for introducing students to heterogenous integration. Hence, we also plan to expose students in a community college, in prime position to train technicians and engineers for the upcoming Intel chip fab to be opened in central Ohio, to flexible electronics via an accessible and hands-on course to be developed. Thus, we propose a novel and timely program that addresses both practical and immediate needs of semiconductor electronics that will expand with the impact of flexible and wearable devices.

The proposal is intended to identify and demonstrate that edge-computing implemented via MOx TFTs on resource-constrained flexible systems is an ideal ‘breeding ground’ for the development of reconfigurable neural accelerators. It is also a natural platform to excite and captivate students of engineering and technician degrees to become interested in the semiconductor industry. To this end, we first explore the most appropriate TLGs circuit topologies as well as optimal device parameters to implement capable logic building blocks by an iterative computer modeling, TFT process refinement, SPICE parameterization and logic circuit simulation cycle.  This methodology will allow us to progressively obtain more stable and finely tuned TLGs. Products of this iterative loop (i.e. capable, stable and novel TFT devices) will be put to use in the final phase of the project to implement a six-input reconfigurable TLG example that can be applied to adaptive and secure logic system design, along with a compact full-adder circuit crucial for the design of efficient arithmetic units. The third basic circuit to be implemented is a simple 3XOR artificial neural network that can illustrate TLGs neuromorphic capabilities. Finally, the insights gained from this work and general promise of flexible electronics will be used to usher students to careers in the semiconductor industry that will be expanding in the next decade.

A highly capable workforce will be the foundation of global leadership in this emerging area. Consequently, strategies for workforce development in partnership with community colleges, four-year institutions and industry will be a key focus. Our planning effort will also invest in pilot cross-institutional projects to accelerate engagement of individuals from underrepresented communities. Planned workshops will assess the educational structure and training programs along with process integration and technology ramp-up to rapidly establish the United States as the center of ferroelectric innovation.

Currently, the design and optimization of functional blocks and chips are implemented in different domains without self-consistent links between different models, and without co-design or co-optimization between them. This project, if successful, will translate to sustained innovations in the microelectronics industry at-large and permit the US to maintain global leadership in microelectronics, delivering systems that achieve more-than-Moore scaling for years to come. This teaming project will help meet the future workforce needs in microelectronics, utilizing the Nation’s First Semiconductor Degrees Program (SDP) just launched at Purdue University.

Further, scientists are increasingly called upon to engage in public outreach about their research. Many people with graduate degrees in science are employed in roles involving public outreach. For these reasons, education on conducting public engagement with science should be meaningfully integrated into STEM graduate education. This NSF Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Cincinnati will investigate the value of systematic instruction in public engagement with science for meaningful public engagement, interdisciplinary collaboration, and diversity and inclusion in STEM. The researchers will develop a 3-part educational sequence called the ""Engaging Science"" curriculum. The curriculum is innovative in its use of interdisciplinary collaboration, community partnership, and perspectives from the philosophy of science to provide graduate students with the background and skills needed to lead effective public engagement with science. This research project will rigorously examine the transformative impact of public engagement with science instruction, with the potential to advance the public reach of STEM disciplines and diversity and inclusion in STEM disciplines. 

The project will run three annual cycles of the Engaging Science curriculum with thirty graduate students in each cycle. The three part curriculum begins with an intensive workshop providing hands-on experience in a museum setting. A semester-long course then follows which culminates in outreach projects conducted by multidisciplinary teams. Third, and finally an internship with a community partner organization leads to an individual outreach project. A mixed-methods convergent parallel research design will be used to combine surveys, interviews, focus groups, and archival data. The study will examine the curriculum's potential to equip graduate students to engage public audiences more meaningfully. The research plan combines quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the unique and additive impact of each level of training on short- and long-term outcomes. This approach will facilitate the adaptation of the curriculum for implementation in diverse contexts.

This form of writing support may work for students who already possess the knowledge and skills to write successfully in their fields, but it is not inclusive nor best practice. Moreover, without systematic writing support, students who are either members of populations historically underrepresented in STEM fields or international students especially face obstacles to success in graduate programs. For students who struggle to differentiate disciplinary characteristics of effective writing from their advisors’ idiosyncratic expectations, engaging in these existing forms of writing support can be confusing, frustrating, and futile. In addition, such writing instruction and intervention methods do not help students develop self-efficacy, i.e., the belief that they can carry out a specific task to achieve the desired result. It is anticipated that self-efficacy will lead to improved confidence in writing abilities and higher success rates for students. This NSF Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to Auburn University will implement an innovative, multifaceted, sustainable writing program for graduate students in engineering. The structure of the program will encourage them to develop self-efficacy in writing. The research is innovative because it takes existing and evidence-based components of writing instruction and intervention — including workshops, graduate-level writing courses, small group writing support, and writing-intensive curriculum development — and integrates them within the disciplinary contexts of engineering. The research seeks to equip graduate students with strategies and resources for writing effectively in STEM fields and to establish evidence-based, systemic writing instruction and interventions that are sustainable, scalable, and adaptable across STEM contexts. 

The Writing SySTEM comprises four components: (1) workshops to teach writing skills and promote the recruitment of diverse participants into other components, (2) discipline-specific graduate writing courses, (3) peer writing groups, and (4) writing resources hosted on a publicly available Open Educational Resource site. Students may electively participate in any of the components. The goal of this research is to determine how components of the SySTEM, individually or in concert, affect STEM writing abilities by evaluating students from small (biosystems), medium (aerospace), and large (civil) graduate engineering programs at Auburn University. Relationships among self-efficacy, self-regulation of writing, and writing ability will be evaluated using direct and indirect measures. Student-focused direct measures include students’ self-efficacy and self-regulatory factors for writing and the quality of their writing as assessed by the research team. Indirectly, students will be interviewed to acquire additional information about their experiences participating in the Writing SySTEM’s components and their self-efficacy and self-regulatory factors for writing.

The number of PhDs awarded steadily increased while the percentage of tenured faculty shrunk dramatically. Consequently, the vast majority of Ph.D. degree recipients will not go on to a tenured position but instead will pursue a variety of career paths outside of academia and in a wide range of sectors, including industry, non-profits, and governmental agencies. To supplement existing Ph.D. programs by equipping graduate students with the complex knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to be successful professionals in various careers, the project team has created and piloted a micro-credentialing training program: Ph.D. Progression. By completing Ph.D. Progression badges, Ph.D. students can gain skills in key areas such as communication, management, self-awareness, research, and teaching towards serving effectively in a diverse, inclusive, and global professional landscape. The digital badging system included in Ph.D. Progression also allows students to monitor their progress and demonstrate directly to employers the outcomes from the time they invested in their professional development. This NSF Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award will support the expansion of the Ph.D. Progression content to be widely accessible with newly integrated perspectives from the workforce through the creation of a consortium of academic and non-academic institutions.

The project aims to increase the number of Ph.D. Progression badges and integrate workforce perspective and assessments directly into badge content. The project team will also create mentoring circles and sponsored internship opportunities for students. Students will work on short projects with industry professionals to apply their learning and gain hands-on professional mentorship. These activities will allow students to interact with employers during their academic training and learn to communicate effectively with them. In addition, students will get a sense of the diverse identities, backgrounds, experiences, and expertise within the STEM Ph.D. workforce. These interactions will also increase the value of the credentials to both the workforce and students. Reaching these goals will involve establishing partnerships with industry, universities, and other Boston University offices. Therefore, the project team intends to use and evaluate a consortium operating within an Equitable Collaboration Framework to involve all these partners equitably in the implementation and management of the project. Through analysis of data collected from students, industry partners, and trainers, the project will generate and disseminate knowledge about: a) how academic institutions can enhance Ph.D. student preparation for a broad range of careers through self-paced badges, and b) how professional development and doctoral program improvements are informed by emerging workforce needs and shifting job markets. Data sources include: enrollment (pre-) and post-completion surveys, badge activities and assessments, Ph.D. student annual exit survey data, post-graduation job market outcomes, participant interviews, and employer interviews and surveys. Project findings will help answer questions about student motivation, industry engagement, learning outcomes in the proposed training model, employment outcomes, and participant and employer perceptions of career preparation.

Scholars have come to label these ""wicked problems"" because they are highly complex and marked by fundamental disagreement among stakeholders regarding their cause and possible solution. Nevertheless, it is precisely these problems that society most needs to address. This NSF Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to the Ohio State University will pilot, test, and validate an innovative project that trains graduate students to become ""wicked"" scientists—researchers who can work effectively in transdisciplinary teams to tackle the complexities, uncertainties, and conflictive nature of such problems. To do so effectively, graduate students need to be experts in their respective fields. However, they also need to develop transdisciplinary skills to collaborate successfully with fellow researchers and other stakeholders. This project uses a comprehensive and integrated conceptual framework of ""wicked science"" to pilot, test, and validate such training. The program of study will take the form of an interdisciplinary graduate minor that consists of three courses and an e-portfolio. This approach includes the development of a community of practice consisting of students, alumni, faculty, and other stakeholders that fosters long-term professional learning. Lessons from the training program will be organized and disseminated so that they can be readily adopted by other institutions of higher education in the United States and beyond.

The researchers will use a mixed-methods approach that integrates validated psychometric assessments and ethnographic methods to examine whether and how the project succeeds in training ""wicked scientists"" and creating an institutional culture of convergence. The program assessment consists of four parts. First is the assessment of courses and course components and their effectiveness in training different core competencies. Second is an overall assessment of students’ core competencies after completion of the graduate interdisciplinary specialization. Third is a controlled comparison of core competencies of students enrolled in the program and those who are not. The final part is a study of the larger institutional context and how it affects student training and the program more broadly. The overarching hypothesis is that students who complete all the program components and participate in the community of practice will show improved competency development and higher scores across all program measures. These measures will include the four validated psychometric instruments compared to students who partially complete the training program or do not participate at all.

This project will develop an innovative new model that trains graduate students as well as reviewers and editors to provide feedback focused on improvement, ultimately improving science and strengthening the STEM workforce. Science advances because scientists collect data, develop methods, and generate theories that become part of a shared scientific record. To be part of this shared record, scientific works go through a review process whereby acknowledged experts and leaders within the field evaluate a work’s validity, quality, and rigor. This process, called peer review, remains a hallmark of the excellence of the U.S. scientific enterprise and is critical for promoting and maintaining ethical standards for scientific research. Despite peer review’s place as a core scientific practice, peer review is a skill not explicitly taught during scientific graduate training. Novice scientists must reach a mastery level before they become sufficiently qualified to be invited into the role of reviewer. Then, these evaluative processes are typically learned “on the job” without the benefit of training or oversight in how to provide feedback that is helpful, professional, and fair. The role of modern peer review is primarily one of gatekeeping, and rarely provides useful, actionable feedback on improvement or insight into how or why a decision was made. From the point of view of the novice, decisions can appear haphazard and further obscure the foundational principles of how to perform effective and fair peer review. This project aims to implement and study practices that can foster the training of novice scientists in peer review, to improve the scientific community’s approach to peer review as an improvement and feedback process, and ultimately to advance better science.  
 
This project will develop strategic programming for both graduate students and more senior peer reviewers and journal editors that builds awareness, knowledge, and support for an improvement-based approach to peer review. This approach re-imagines the interactions between reviewers and trainees to provide more useful feedback on papers for publication and to meet students where they are across a range of institutional types, experiences, and backgrounds. A new paper development system (Formative And Interactive Review) will provide a novel institutional structure for fundamentally different interactions between reviewers and trainees. By working with national partners in both graduate education and in scientific journals, this project will lead to potentially transformative changes in how STEM graduate students are trained to evaluate innovation in their fields as well as how reviewers and editors advance quality science and cultivate the next generation of STEM leaders.

Despite the in-depth training during their degree programs, most of these students do not have the broad skills needed to start positions at a mid-career level (equivalent to 5+ years of work experience). This NSF Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Rowan University will pilot a new research-to-practice training model to bridge this gap. Students will progressively build their skills and learn how to apply them to the transportation industry through intentional learning experiences built around a cognitive apprenticeship model. In this program, transportation Ph.D. and Master’s students who are conducting research and writing a thesis will develop technical competencies, business and communication skills, leadership and team development approaches, and build their networking capabilities. The training program is novel as few programs focus on applying a cognitive apprenticeship model to assist students with learning how to apply their research skills in a non-academic setting. The training program also collaborates closely with industry and government partners, which will help ensure that the transportation Ph.D. students are prepared for mid-career level positions upon graduation. Moreover, this experience will benefit all participating graduate students because it provides practical experiences that will assist in professional development. The revised structure of the transportation Ph.D. program with an emphasis on industrial/government applications will attract a diverse student population interested in creating value for the local and broader community.

This pilot transportation Ph.D. training program will seek to answer “How can a research-to-practice model assist students in preparing for a transportation engineering career outside of academia?” More specifically, it will address three research questions: (1) What impact does the research-to-practice graduate model have on developing transportation engineering doctoral students’ professional identity? (2) How does the cognitive apprenticeship framework prepare doctoral students for professional practice in transportation engineering? and (3) What influences does the research-to-practice graduate model have on doctoral students’ motivation towards degree completion? The research design uses qualitative and explanatory mixed methods approaches, including student reflections, interviews, and surveys, to address the proposed research questions. As both professional identity and motivation are related to persistence and retention within graduate degree programs, particularly for students from groups that are underrepresented in the field, this research will help address the preparation of a diverse doctoral student population for careers in transportation engineering. This effort is also anticipated to lead to better retention of students in the transportation Ph.D. program. This project’s completion will improve understanding of how a cognitive apprenticeship model can be applied to scaffold doctoral students’ professional development in preparation for non-academic careers. Although the results will be specific to the transportation engineering doctoral population, using a mixed methods approach will help achieve results that could be transferable to other engineering programs and contexts.

This project, ""Transdisciplinary Research in Graduate Engineering Education (TREE),"" will create and offer workshop-based thematic modular units in three thrust competencies (intercultural competence, community-engaged practice, and qualitative and quantitative mixed research methods) and an operationalized service learning component. The TREE project will search for multi-scalar answers to two primary research questions: 1) Are the thrust competencies workshops and thematic modular units taught in the workshops able to effectively and efficiently develop and improve engineering graduate students’ ability to conduct transdisciplinary research? 2) Can the operationalization of these principles through collaborative service learning projects effectively and efficiently enhance engineering graduate students’ ability to conduct transdisciplinary research? The project will provide new educational opportunities to graduate students engaged with local communities, sketching and running simulations on initial, medial, and final stages of dominant and subordinate processes in search of sustainable solutions. Such collaborations will support transdisciplinary thinking and problem solving and the co-construction and soft assembly of complex solutions that value the inputs across disciplines and individuals who bring multicultural insight to the decision-making table. It will impact students, communities, and how they think about knowledge to achieve ecologically and humanly sustainable solutions. Moreover, it will lead to the design of scalable and transformative approaches based on thematic modular units and service learning, which will be shared via a well-structured dissemination plan to be adopted and used to guide other STEM graduate programs at TAMUK and across the nation.

The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.

However, the communities that care for and utilize natural resources are often not involved in shaping the research. In Hawaiʻi, these resources are integral to the livelihoods and cultural practices of Native Hawaiians. The Marine Biology Graduate Program at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa (UHM) trains emerging leaders in marine biology research, conservation, and education. Graduate students have typically received strong training in the natural sciences but lack guidance on the social and cultural aspects of how knowledge is created. This NSF Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to UHM seeks to transform marine biology from a “field-based science” that positions researchers as separate from the ecosystems they study to a “community-embedded science” that recognizes the fundamental connections between marine life and human communities and cultures. This innovative project will train early career scientists in establishing and maintaining reciprocal relationships with local communities throughout their professional careers. Additionally, improving communication between the scientific workforce and the public increases trust around science-related policies. 

Using place-based methodologies in Hawaiʻi, students will be immersed in a community-based research partnership at the Heʻeia National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR). An intensive two-week period immediately prior to the students’ first fall semester incorporates several interrelated components. First are stewardship, relationship building, and service learning opportunities with Heʻeia NERR partner organizations. Second are readings, lectures, and class discussions of case studies where scientific values and community values can often misalign. Third are opportunities for self-directed learning and reflections, with a fourth activity of cohort-building and establishing of peer-to-peer mentorship structures. Students are introduced to Native Hawaiian kilo (observation and inquiry) and kuleana (responsibility and interdependence) as fundamental practices connecting people to the land. Through hands-on experiences establishing connections with local Indigenous stewardship organizations, the course emphasizes the positionality and responsibility of researchers to the places and communities in which their work is embedded. During the fall semester, students engage in iterative reflection and knowledge integration. A highly interdisciplinary instruction and evaluation team has designed course readings, guest lectures, and discussions to explore case studies at the intersection of technology, culture, and scientific practice, including data stewardship and governance, with an emphasis on Indigenous knowledge and data sovereignty. Grounding the curriculum in an ethical framework promotes reciprocal engagement and knowledge co-production with communities wherever these emerging researchers work, transforming the graduate education culture at an Indigenous place of learning. Formative evaluation using an embedded assessment approach will inform iterative program improvements. Research findings from a summative evaluation, including analysis of participant student and department surveys, research activities reports, and document analyses of faculty syllabi/assignments, will be shared broadly to inform place-based approaches to STEM graduate education.

For large sections of the U.S., an increase and intensification in these extreme hydroclimate events are predicted. Precise, accurate, early, and actionable forecasts of these hazards are needed to save lives, protect property, and sustain commerce needs. The hydrologic forecasting research community is responding with new ideas, techniques, and tools driven by recent advances in data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML). Rapid and effective translation of these research advances are urgently needed in water system operations to help improve water hazard responses and planning. These advances must be developed and incorporated with the operational weather/water forecasting community and the businesses, industry, and the public that depend on them. Simultaneously, graduate students' training requires greater inter- and transdisciplinary curriculum inclusion. This change in training will allow these future water professionals and leaders in water science to comprehend the practical significance of research advances and develop skills to effectively translate them into forecast and decision-making frameworks used in operational settings. This NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) project will address the multifaceted and integrated needs of researchers, forecasters, and users of forecasts, by launching a unique hydrologic science program focusing on the critical linkage of research to operations, or ""R2O."" The program of study will be co-produced with those working in the water prediction community to generate a pipeline of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers capable of diagnosing water-hazard forecasting needs. This co-production effort will result in the design of prediction tools and techniques using the latest advances in AI, ML, and data science, and the dissemination of the forecast products in actionable forms for a wide array of decision-makers. The project anticipates training a diverse set of 115 master's and Ph.D. students, including 28 funded trainees from civil engineering, geography, and computer science. Student recruitment efforts will focus on groups traditionally underrepresented in their participation in academia and water industries. 

This project will expose students to a variety of professional and simulated professional contexts and strengthen student competencies to be facilitators, innovators, and leaders. The training program features unique modalities, content, and delivery to build competency through team science, challenge-based learning, co-production, and iterative self-reflection. Innovative educational aspects include domestic and international study tours, mock operational forecasting, practical labs, roundtable discussions, mixed mentoring, experiential learning, internships, broad-scale and interdisciplinary team building, and professional development. Graduates of the program will bring to the hydrologic forecasting workforce a unique combination of attributes. The first two are: (1) deep disciplinary knowledge in hydrologic science coupled with (2) comprehensive skills spanning the cutting edge of AI and ML, and the use of advanced industry-standard software.  Third and fourth are: (3) a holistic understanding of the complex hydrologic forecasting and decision-making system paired with (4) the competencies to be thought leaders in the hydrologic forecasting community of practice. Trainees will accelerate research advances in three focal areas: (1) creating new data science workflows to characterize multi-scale geophysical and climate drivers of hydrologic processes; (2) advancing models and predictive tools to reduce the uncertainty of hydrologic prediction; and (3) improving the communication of forecast products for practical operations. Coordinated internal and external project evaluation from multiple disciplines, open-source software development, data curation, and new pedagogical approaches to train at the interface of computer science, engineering, and geoscience will support the project goals of convergent research and the delivery of broader impacts in academia, government, and the private sector.

IIITSEs are collaborative, culturally affirming, and solutions-oriented research projects that center diverse knowledge systems to respond to community needs, support cohorts of racially diverse faculty and students, and promote a just, equitable, diverse, and inclusive campus and community within and beyond the STEM disciplines. The current societal moment has laid bare structural inequities and injustice within the academy. In particular, the system for graduate education in STEM does not foster an environment for Indigenous scholars to thrive. To address this problem, diverse identities, critical scholarship, sovereignty, and self-determination must be centered. This project will engage Indigenous graduate students at Arizona State University in immersive learning experiences led by a faculty cohort of predominantly Indigenous and Latinx scholars. These immersive learning experiences will allow students to develop critical skills in collaboration, communication, and problem solving while also cultivating a space for deep reflection, cultural affirmation, and empowerment. The learning community aims to 1) promote interdisciplinary collaboration in STEM, 2) elevate Indigenous faculty collaboration across disciplines and across the institution, and 3) support culturally affirming research experiences for graduate students in STEM.

The IIITSE concept is underpinned by the inclusive pedagogical approach of the “Four R’s” (Respect, Relevance, Reciprocity, Responsibility) framework for Indigenous student success in higher education. Integration of the 4Rs framework into STEM pedagogy can take many forms, including classroom and research curricula that use cultural knowledge and practices. Such approaches produce positive outcomes of Indigenous student success in undergraduate STEM courses; however, it remains unclear how transferring these principles to graduate-level STEM research will influence student perceptions and outcomes, or how it might translate into lasting institutional changes that support racial equity for Indigenous scholars. This project aims to answer an overarching research question: How does integration of the 4Rs framework into graduate research via IIITSEs improve outcomes and increase racial equity for Indigenous people? The project will evaluate how well the program adheres to the 4Rs, and how the 4Rs relate to racial equity in STEM for graduate Indigenous scholars. Qualitative methods will include interviews of students, faculty, staff, and community members who participate in the IIITSE program. Using the 4Rs approach, racial equity will be enacted through all parts of the research process, while simultaneously studying the progress and sharing findings so that changes to research initiatives can be implemented and transformation of graduate education can be accelerated.

In this project, academic partners will help refine and co-develop materials, procedures, and policies to mitigate racial inequities in their respective disciplines in engineering. One of the focal points of this work will be to explore agency and to investigate and uncover coping and advocacy strategies in engineering. Additionally critical communication strategies and policy strategies for instituting change and empowerment within engineering and engineering education will also be addressed. A primary broader impact of this project will be the amplification of Black student voices and agentic actions in their continuing work to achieve equitable representation in engineering and STEM fields. The project will support efforts by researchers, administrators, and educators to help students of color broaden their participation in the engineering workforce.  

This research project will provide early stage and exploratory insights into engineering and STEM education  by: (1) contributing to an empirical understanding of structural and cultural supports and systemic barriers in engineering, STEM, and higher education; (2) conducting an evidence-based examination of the ways Black graduate student agency in engineering education contributes to the dismantling of systemic inequities within the enterprise of their fields of engineering; and (c) situating the lessons, values, and habits students learn that are not explicitly taught through the formal curriculum that oftentimes deters systemic changes from occurring at the administrative level.  This work is split into four phases distributed throughout 4 years: (1) Reflection; (2) Action and Reflection; (3) Impact; and (4) Action and Application. These phases are intended to create opportunities for critical conversations to happen between the academic partners and key academic leaders and stakeholders in engineering departments. Process evaluation will address questions regarding project implementation and impact. Along with scholarly manuscripts and presentations, public facing articles and op-eds for mainstream press, professional development documents and curriculum will be disseminated.

However, data science lifecycles are assembled and operated by a wide variety of individuals and institutions with varying levels of expertise. While to err is human, the consequences of errors in critical data science lifecycles can be catastrophic. Unreliable decisions can potentially have enormous negative impacts such as loss of life, widespread contagions, and economic depression. To respond to this critical challenge, this NSF Research Traineeship project is establishing a graduate program of study, ""Dependable Data Driven Discovery (D4)"" that engages faculty across multiple disciplines to train students with diverse scientific backgrounds to recognize risks to dependable data driven discovery and to develop corresponding mitigation strategies. One hundred students are expected to participate from disciplines such as computer science, mathematics, statistics, bioengineering, and computational biology, including 32 funded graduate (MS & PhD) trainees and 16 undergraduate students from minority groups who are underrepresented in their participation in these fields.
 
Trainees will gain a holistic perspective of the entire data science lifecycle through coursework as well as collaborative, transdisciplinary research. Three focal areas comprise the D4 research and training agenda. First is a focus on formal foundations, methodology, and tools for a dependable data driven discovery framework. Second is an examination of risk mitigation methods to handle noise in data, limited training data, and uncertainty prediction and interpretability of machine learning models. The third focal area addresses quality assurance issues for protein function prediction and cellular engineering processes to direct undifferentiated cells into mature, functional cells with dependable data science lifecycles. The project will develop a new graduate certificate in dependable data science to train students in dependability issues within data science lifecycles. Through coursework, trainees will experience the entire data science lifecycle several times, each with an increasingly deeper understanding of the risks, measures, and risks mitigation mechanisms. Trainees will also engage with industry partners to examine their data science lifecycles and discuss risk mitigation methods. The capstone project course will reinforce trainees’ technical skills to address the above research problems in data science, biological science, and engineering as well as written and oral communication skills. Trainees will interact with outside collaborators through the D4 seminars, gain experiential learning with industry partners, conduct original research through capstone projects, and work in internships, resulting in awareness of dependable data science lifecycles and risk mitigation mechanisms across Iowa State University, local industry, NGOs, and government. The project will engage in outreach activities through two existing Iowa State University infrastructures: ISU Science Bound  and ISU Extension and Outreach with Iowa 4-H.

To address the future workforce needs at the Human-Technology Frontier, professionals are needed who are effective at both finding and solving problems. Traditional approaches to graduate student training are constrained in preparing innovators for emerging societal challenges. In these models, experts often define the problems to be solved, depriving students of critical learning opportunities in problem identification. Instead, this project will investigate a potentially transformative model of graduate education that makes students the center of innovation through immersive, interdisciplinary, and cross-cultural experiences. Students will be trained to identify and solve problems through a graduate-student-focused adaptation of the Renaissance Foundry educational Model (RFM). This model has been previously demonstrated at the undergraduate level for effective development of holistic, ""T-shaped"" professionals with strong problem identification and problem-solving skills in depth, complemented by broad collaborative and interdisciplinary traits. Students will learn to apply their training as they collaboratively find and address challenges at the food-energy-water nexus in Appalachian, Native American, and other rural communities, which are at the center of the mission of Tennessee Tech University (TTU). The project will directly support 20 students (8 PhD; 12 MS) as NRT trainees with stipends. No fewer than 60 additional graduate student trainees will be included, along with undergraduate and K-12 students. 

Four objectives will guide the implementation of this project. First is to modify and adapt the RFM as an interdisciplinary, graduate-level STEM educational model. Second is to build graduate level organizational outreach, supports, and capacities to implement and sustain the RFM. Third is to implement and test the model with graduate students, and fourth is to support and mentor students' transition from education to independent research and early STEM career pathways. Key elements of this training model include opportunities for immersion in partnering communities for problem identification as well as preparation for such experiences through a cultural training course; and guidance in ensuring that the problems identified and the research-based solutions developed are aligned with community needs. Trainees will be co-mentored by a team of researchers collectively providing technical and socio-cultural expertise, and each trainee will complete a program of study consistent with their degree program objectives, receive extensive and guided training in research methods and research at the FEW nexus, as well as career training and opportunities for internship experiences.

Some of the most vexing challenges include rehabilitating sensorimotor coordination to prevent falls, restoring motor function after paralysis, and regenerating muscle after traumatic injuries. Despite the development of impressive devices, people with disabilities abandon assistive technologies at alarmingly high rates largely because their perspectives are not included in the development process. Assistive technology is increasingly more intertwined in a web of human, ethical, legal, psychological, and social factors. Meanwhile, disability groups seek to participate in the research process to shed light on these issues. Against this background, graduate engineering education to date has been largely isolated from the complexity of disabled persons’ experiences, from rehabilitation therapy education, and from fields examining the larger impacts of disability and technology in the community. Moreover, traditional discipline-specific training inhibits transdisciplinary thinking that can lead to versatile rehabilitative technologies. To address these shortcomings in graduate education, this NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) project will create a graduate traineeship program that equips students to work on transdisciplinary research teams that successfully partner with people with disabilities to develop rehabilitation and assistive technologies. The training program will: develop courses to teach skills for spanning perspectives in human-machine systems, create a community that immerses students in multiple facets of disability, and test a model that promotes research-inspired collaborative teaching across disciplines. The significance of the program is that it will produce a traineeship model for engineers, psychologists, and urban experts to collaborate with therapy professionals and the disability community to deliver technology for the most complex rehabilitation challenges that people with disabilities use in their daily lives. The project anticipates training 20 PhD and 10 MS students, including 15 funded trainees, from Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, Exercise Science, Experimental Psychology, and Urban Studies.    

Trainees will participate on three transdisciplinary teams that will include people with lived disability experience according to the Integrated Knowledge Translation Principles for teaming with the disability community. Three objectives guide the project team's work. First is to create physical human-machine interaction technologies that improve individuals’ abilities to access, engage with, and manipulate their physical, social, and sensory environments. Second is to understand human processing and communication and develop artificial processing and communication to allow people with limited sensorimotor function to engage in meaningful activities (e.g., self-feeding, grooming, cooking) in realistic environments. Third is to develop therapeutic agents that are engineered to treat organ defects at a cellular and tissue level. This novel, human-centered traineeship model will include users in design, development, and implementation of technologies, while expanding students’ mindsets and skills to work interactively towards these goals.

However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the analysis of large datasets (e.g., from brain imaging or other observations of brain signals) on which the development of exciting neural technologies are based will need targeted design of data processing, machine learning tools, and artificial intelligence approaches. Therefore, there is a need for a convergent science curriculum that leverages the latest advances in team-based science to create a workforce capable of optimizing advances made in neuroengineering to maximize the impact of this field for the broadest possible segments of society. This NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) project, NeuralStorm, is addressing several of NSF’s research challenges, including Harnessing the Data Revolution, Growing Convergence Research, and The Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier, by developing a graduate curriculum that allows students to gain expertise within a specific area (e.g., computer science, engineering, medicine) while also contributing to cross-disciplinary problem-solving in neuroengineering. The project anticipates training 70 Ph.D. and 20 masters’ students, including 30 funded trainees, from computer science, engineering, neuroscience, and psychology. 

The NeuralStorm project will bring together trainees from broad academic backgrounds with three objectives. First is to ensure they are grounded in the complex neuroethical issues associated with interfacing the nervous system. Second is to equip the students with intelligent communication skills that allow them to work effectively across fields. Third is to prepare them to navigate the expected rapid advances in technology throughout their careers in a way that ensures the resulting neurotechnology has the greatest, positive impact for society. NeuralStorm has the potential to revolutionize the way neuroengineers work by enhancing collaboration in multi-disciplinary teams, evaluating user performance and quality of life changes, and assessing the best ways to bring products to market at a reasonable cost to impact broad and diverse segments of society positively. This curriculum will train students to know and understand the various resources available to them, have intelligent conversations about impact across a broad and diverse segment of society, understand how to evaluate and use new advances, and create a reservoir of information that will be made available on a website and through publications, seminars, and workshops. Finally, the leadership team will work to package the convergent ideals of this program for other fields beyond neuroengineering. These training elements will connect evidence-based educational activities to program goals and use rigorous assessment and adaptive learning to ensure success.

As humans continue to modify Earth’s biota, novel species interactions — including invasive species and emergent diseases — will become more commonplace. Effective responses to diseases and damaging species hinge on understanding their causes and impacts. Since the scale of novel interactions ranges from molecules to communities and beyond, accurately predicting the outcomes of newly interacting organisms will increasingly require collaborations and integrated tools shared among biologists, ecologists, computer scientists, and data scientists. This NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) project will bridge the fields of invasion biology, disease ecology, and computer science to discover the causes and consequences of novel interactions at multiple levels of biological organization. The project, ""Understanding Invasion and Disease Ecology and Evolution through Computational Data Education (UandI-DEECoDE),"" will provide its trainees with an interdisciplinary, experiential education; a collaborative and inclusive working environment; research and travel support; and professional skills development for a variety of scientific careers. The traineeship anticipates preparing seventy (70) MS and Ph.D. students, including 16 funded trainees from doctoral programs in Environmental Sciences and Molecular Biosciences. 

This interdisciplinary research and training program of study will provide students with the computational knowledge and skills necessary to maximize the power and scalability of predicting outcomes of context-dependent novel interactions. It will also provide the biological knowledge necessary to develop innovative and timely solutions to counter emergent diseases and invasive species. Furthermore, trainees will explore the conceptual temporal framework of species interactions (from initial contact to persistence to expansion) to motivate new algorithms for evolutionary computation. Trainees will be immersed in a program that emphasizes communication, teamwork, ethics, mentorship, cross-cultural competency, and leadership throughout their graduate studies. The activities will encompass specific interdisciplinary and project-based coursework, professional development institutes, data science bootcamps, mentorship networks, research pods, and the opportunity to conduct science abroad. Direct local impacts will include long-lasting institutional improvements to graduate student life by sustaining more Ph.D. lines and building a solid and inclusive graduate student culture. Scientific literacy, appreciation, and engagement deficits in Northeast Arkansas will be addressed by infusing UandI-DEECoDE into the local community through targeted outreach activities. Beyond the region, UandI-DEECoDE will address the critical roles of global awareness, information systems, and predictive modeling to tackle the growing issues regarding invasive species and diseases. Targeted recruitment efforts, accessible research and training support, and intentional mentorship will increase participation and scientific representation of historically marginalized groups in STEM. UandI-DEECoDE will contribute scientists to the knowledge-based workforce in the Arkansas Delta, one of the most disadvantaged regions in the United States and beyond.

To capitalize on such developments, this NSF Research Traineeships (NRT) project, ""Linking Quantum Sensing TechnoLogies across Disciplines (LinQ-STL),"" is establishing an interdisciplinary program of study to connect research efforts across the St. Louis region between Washington University, the University of Missouri – St. Louis, St. Louis University, and Harris Stowe State University. The project’s vision is to build quantum fluency among scientists and engineers spanning the disciplines of chemistry, biology, physics, medicine, engineering, and mathematics. LinQ-STL achieves these goals by building common vocabulary, research community awareness, research identity, and technical skills that will prepare the trainees to launch a range of professional careers. The project anticipates training 100 students, including 40 funded trainees from chemistry, physics, computer, and electrical and system engineering doctorate programs. Furthermore, the project's investigators seek to create institutional change in graduate education by demonstrating how career-building internships and experiences aligned with students’ professional interests can affect their career trajectories and success. This model will be broadly disseminated to other disciplines and institutions.

Three essential areas guide the experimental, theoretical, and computational work of this project: “looking out” beyond the Earth into the universe; “looking in” to meso- and microscopic domains of quantum bits and materials phenomena; and “looking where we cannot yet see” comprising efforts to identify heretofore unmeasured domains such as dark matter detection. LinQ-STL will pursue opportunities for quantum sensing, with cross-cutting themes such as new instrumentation and new materials, data-enabled science via machine learning, and photon detection over decades of energy scales. Researchers “looking out” (astrophysics) will develop observational tools across orders of magnitude in photon energy, enabling the acquisition of massive data sets. Researchers “looking in” at the smallest material length scales will use photon spectroscopies and the unexpected benefits of materials defects to probe new behaviors. Finally, “looking where we cannot yet see” includes new quantum light imaging modalities applicable in biology and medical imaging, and new probes of topological and quantum phenomena in materials. Research by the project team will also probe how students perceive themselves as science learners via their science identity, racial and gender identity, and efficacy beliefs—to diversify the workforce by acknowledging the role of identity in enabling students to become the next generation of leaders and teachers.

The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs. Because of its alignment with the research thrusts within the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), the project is receiving co-funding from the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.

Through investigations of the neurobiological mechanisms of learning and teaching, Educational Neuroscience (EdNeuro) promises to revolutionize education. The EdNeuro approach transcends the one-size-fits-all approach and personalizes learning, thereby capitalizing on the strengths of individual learners while also addressing areas where their learning can be improved. This NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) award, ""TRANSdisciplinary Convergence in Educational Neuroscience Doctoral (TRANSCEND) Training Program,"" will realize EdNeuro's potential. The project will bring together transdisciplinary research training in Cognitive Neuroscience, Education, Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics, currently siloed within distinct degree programs, to transform doctoral training. TRANSCEND anticipates preparing 50 Ph.D. students, including 25 funded trainees. Many of them will be neurodiverse learners — a group in higher education whose relatively low participation in STEM fields of study is particularly under-recognized. With a strong emphasis on neurodiversity, team science, and co-creation of research and training opportunities with community stakeholders, TRANSCEND will prepare diverse cohorts of trainees with the technical and transferable professional skills needed to excel in the 21st century STEM workforce within and outside of academia.

TRANSCEND's unifying themes include (1) Innovation in EdNeuro: A bidirectional learning approach and a three-stage lab-to-school cyclical model will lead to experimentally rigorous and ecologically valid research grounded in practice, with the potential for its discoveries to translate to practice rapidly. (2) Neurodiversity: TRANSCEND centers neurodiverse learners (e.g., with ADHD, dyslexia, or autism spectrum disorder) both as a key investigation population and as trainees. TRANSCEND will prioritize recruitment and retention of neurodiverse trainees, capitalizing on an expansive partner network including NSF INCLUDES partners. (3) Team Science: TRANSCEND adds a deliberate and formal implementation of team science approaches while promoting diversity to enhance team creativity and productivity. (4) Community: The program will cultivate a culture of support and a sense of belonging through internships, receiving and providing mentorship, and participation of partners, community stakeholders, trainees' families, and faculty and students from other institutions in program activities. Transformations to graduate training and research will be sustained beyond NSF funding by a planned graduate certificate in EdNeuro. Practices and strategies will be disseminated widely for other institutions to follow the TRANSCEND model.

However, due to the traditional separation between career trajectories in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and those in the healthcare sector, STEM graduate students often do not have training in a clinical setting. Consequently, many are not aware of the ethical principles, laws, and policies associated with the development and use of technologies in those settings. As a result, advancements and innovations made in the design and manufacturing of biomedical devices in academic institutions often do not appropriately address the application side of the technology. This gap in STEM education can be addressed by developing a convergent research program that weaves different disciplines together. Knowledge of the applied side of medical technology research is necessary for effective and sustainable innovation. This NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) project brings together the awardee institution with the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, to address this gap by creating and fostering a use-inspired, human-centered outlook in STEM graduate students through a set of structured and convergent research and training activities. The project anticipates training 34 Ph.D. students, including 17 funded trainees from engineering, design, manufacturing, and science disciplines. 

Trainees will focus on research problems associated with imaging devices and technologies, additively manufactured implants and devices, personable diagnostic devices, tissue repair and regeneration devices, and applications of cybersecurity, data science, and artificial intelligence to medical devices. Trainees will follow a training schedule consisting of NRT core curriculum courses, applied and experiential learning components, including a Mayo Clinic residency, MedTech accelerator participation, a Graduate-Undergraduate Mentorship (GUM) Program, and experiential and professional activities. NRT trainees will learn aspects that are not traditionally part of STEM education, such as limitations and opportunities for technology-human interactions in medical and clinical settings. They will also gain an understanding of ethical principles and develop an entrepreneurial mindset and aptitude. This training experience will enhance students’ education by providing breath in the three research thrust areas: (1) Human-technology interface in medical devices, (2) Ethics in research and innovation, (3) Law and policies in research and technology. Cross-disciplinary teams of faculty are selected as the advising team for each NRT trainee; and tudents will integrate at least one of these research thrusts into their specific research topic through their dissertation.

For example, the external deflection of a composite airplane wing can be measured in inches but the displacements of the molecules inside that composite material, which ultimately govern the deflection, are a fraction of the thickness of a hair. With continuing advances in computers and computational modeling, it is now possible to reliably predict what happens at any of these scales. However, it is still challenging to design predictive models across multiple scales. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) project will facilitate research and training that combines novel artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques with traditional computer simulations and high-performance computing. The new methods will preserve physical structure from the small to the large and enable the discovery of new science and engineering applications of importance to society. The project anticipates training 100 Ph.D. students, including 35 funded trainees, from a variety of areas, including Computational Mathematics, various Engineering disciplines, Mathematics, Statistics and Probability, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Physics and Astronomy. 
 
The research and training in this project are targeted at modeling multi-scale phenomena where well-formed and validated modeling hierarchies exist but where traditional modeling and simulation techniques break down. Recent years have witnessed the development of machine learning approaches and their broad impacts in computational modeling and scientific computing. Despite the overwhelming success machine learning has had in other areas such as natural language processing and image analysis, it is unlikely that modeling exclusively based on machine learning can replace traditional simulations that explicitly incorporate the domain knowledge arising from the physical mechanisms, symmetries, and constraints. This project will advance training and research in predictive modeling of multi-scale phenomena in complex fluids, biophysics, and polymeric materials by advancing the hybridization of traditional accurate, high-performance numerical methods with modern structure-preserving machine learning techniques. The project will develop a systematic approach to train a hierarchy of models that result in tractable simulations using high-fidelity computed and experimental data. These will unlock challenging problems in the application areas of the project and beyond. The project will also deliver a model for educating tomorrow’s graduate students and STEM workforce in predictive modeling of multi-scale phenomena. It will include core coursework leading to a graduate certificate, a course on scientific communication, and targeted short courses in cutting-edge topics, as well as an internship at a partner site and a rigorous professional development program. Upon leaving the program, the trainees will be ready to pursue careers in research and training in academia, industry, or national labs.

These technologies have the potential to fundamentally transform how physical work is performed in industries from manufacturing to services and in occupations ranging from manual labor to highly trained professions. Rather than automating away human labor, cobots have the potential to enhance productivity, safety, and ergonomic conditions for human workers. Realizing this potential will require not only advancing technology to create sufficiently capable robots but also addressing human-centered questions ranging from how individuals interact with robots to how the introduction of robots affects personal life, the workplace, job satisfaction, communities and societies. Despite these broad-ranging and interdisciplinary research challenges, robotic technology is primarily driven by scientists with deep technical backgrounds but little experience with human-centered and societal issues. On the other hand, social scientists studying how robots might affect human work may lack an understanding of the capabilities of robotic technology as well as the possibilities enabled by them. Addressing these challenges will require a new generation of “STEM+” researchers capable of marrying technical and social-scientific knowledge and skills to carry out rigorous, groundbreaking fundamental research at the boundary of people and technology. The INTEGRATE training program provides a unique academic environment to train graduate students in STEM disciplines, including computer science, engineering, psychology, and economics, to become technologists and social scientists equipped to address the significant technical and human-centric challenges at the individual, organizational, and societal scales. The program achieves this goal through key innovations in STEM curricula, experiential research training, professional development opportunities, community development, and program evaluation. Trainees who complete the program will help form a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers who will work across disciplinary boundaries to shape robotic technologies and the future of work in a way that maximizes individual and societal benefit. In addition to advancing and enriching STEM training, the program makes significant societal contributions through new technologies that will improve the lives of workers; new knowledge and guidelines that will improve organizations and industries; and new recommendations that inform labor practices, technology policy, and the legal system.

The INTEGRATE program provides a unique academic environment to enrich the training of graduate students in STEM disciplines, including computer science, engineering, psychology, and economics, to address fundamental research challenges in realizing the integration of robots into the future of work. The program achieves these goals through five key components and innovations. The first is a flexible, personalized curriculum that combines core STEM training with coursework from complementary human-centered disciplines in the form of a set of concentration areas. The second component consists of hands-on, immersive, and mentored research experiences through apprenticeship-based industry-sponsored team research projects on real-world problems, called “Expeditions.” The third element is comprised of opportunities for professional development through internships and secondments at a network of partner industrial and academic organizations. Fourth is the forming of an INTEGRATE Research Community through weekly colloquia, an annual “INTEGRATE Week” event, and significant online presence and activity. Fifth and finally is continuous and rigorous assessment of program effectiveness in training, research productivity, and real-world relevance and impact toward program refinement. This highly interdisciplinary program brings together faculty from computer sciences; mechanical and industrial & systems engineering; psychology; educational psychology; business; law; and public affairs/economics. Throughout the program, trainees participate in research that investigates research challenges at the micro, systems, and macro scales. At the micro level, research includes the design of novel interfaces and algorithms to enable effective teaming between people and robots; studies of how humans build working relationships with robots; investigations of the impact of working with robots on human health, safety, life and job satisfaction, and wellbeing; and development of training programs for people to effectively work with robots. At the systems level, trainees study the integration of robotic assistants into home life, the workplace, and industrial processes; how they must be redesigned to best utilize cobots; how robots change organizations; and the changes in organizational behavior and adoption around robots. At the macro scale, trainee research teams will investigate how the introduction of robots affects human labor across demographic groups and communities and develops public policy changes that might be necessary to maximize the societal utility of robotic technologies. In the program, trainees build research skills that integrate multiple disciplinary perspectives, knowledge, and skills as well as core professional skills in communication, teamwork, and ethical decision making.

Resources must be conserved and reused more effectively, with wastes upcycled into products of value and clean energy. Past investments in new technologies to increase the circular use of resources have fallen short, however, failing to consider cultural perspectives and economic and policy frameworks that are critical to success. New approaches are needed in which engineers and scientists understand and incorporate multiple stakeholder values into their work and confront the role of non-technological factors in advancing circularity. Policymakers also need to understand and incorporate multiple stakeholder values as they develop and then apply science-based approaches that recognize technological constraints. This NSF Research Traineeship project will address these needs by training master’s and doctoral students in the circular use of water and materials in the context of different cultural perspectives, real-world experiences, and academic research. The traineeship anticipates providing unique training opportunities to approximately 300 students, including twenty (20) directly funded trainees and forty (40) trainees that will participate in all aspects of the program with funding from other sources. This training program will benefit society by leading to new technologies, policy and economic instruments, methods, and implementation strategies for the circular use of resources. Trainees will span fields of engineering, science, public affairs, urban planning, and environmental policy.

This project will integrate policy, engineering, and science with a combination of coursework, cutting-edge interdisciplinary research, and internships. Additionally, community interactions led by an Artist-in-Residence are designed to enhance the trainees’ identity and capacity for positive societal impact. Trainees will participate in several key activities. First is cohort-focused coursework on circularity as a system, as well training to: cultivate essential leadership and professional skills, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and promote engaged scholarship on circularity. A second component consists of interdisciplinary graduate research experiences focused on creating circular solutions to currently unsustainable water, energy, and material use. A third aspect is comprised of external internships that build from research projects and/or community engagement and are incorporated directly into the trainee’s thesis or dissertation. Finally, a fourth and novel component of this traineeship will take the form of structured engagements with the community throughout the program led by an embedded Artist-in-Residence. These interactions will result in the cultivation of creative models of self-reflection, collaboration, and social engagement, along with the exploration of each trainee’s impact identity, defined as the potential of one’s work to bring about positive societal impact as seen through personal, communal, and professional aspects of an individual’s practice and interests. These trainees represent a new generation of sustainability and circularity professionals that will serve as connectors between researchers, industry, and communities. This integrated research and education traineeship will result in the creation of a new certificate program and increased interactions with the community and industries.

First is to conduct cutting-edge research in integrating the high renewables electric grid with transportation infrastructure, investigating renewable hydrogen as a fuel and energy storage medium. Second is to understand policies around sustainability, air pollution, and renewable energy, learn to communicate science to all audiences, and appreciate the needs of various stakeholders to create equitable solutions for environmental justice. Third is to develop best practices for human interaction with renewable energy technology by designing solutions based on individual, societal, and political needs. Engaging key stakeholder groups during research and development will accelerate the deployment of renewable technologies and foster effective communication and decision-making on scientific topics. This project will prepare trainees to develop and deploy a model for scientific research that is closely connected with societal challenges through meaningful community engagement and responsive programs.

Existing data for the treatment of alcohol and drug abuse are primarily collected through unreliable self-reports. Other methods are direct measurements on bodily fluids, breath, or sweat, which require penetration through the skin or physical maneuvering, and indirect estimates through interviews and observations. Non-invasive sensing and testing paired with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques offer the promise of vastly improved data collection methods and analysis that in turn can improve treatments. However, the world, and the United States in particular, faces a shortage of trained workforce and innovators in this field. This NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) award will address these needs by preparing master’s and doctoral students to make convergent research contributions in the interdisciplinary fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and secure networked sensing to tackle the growing alcohol and drug crisis, and other social pandemics. The project will provide a unique and comprehensive training opportunity for up to one hundred twenty graduate students, including twenty funded trainees, by combining the disciplines of AI, communication networks, cybersecurity, sensor technologies, interactions with healthcare and legal partners, and a culture of innovation and translational research that considers human factors, law, regulation, communication, and leadership.

This project examines the global and national alcohol/drug abuse crisis from a broad perspective, including technological, ethical, legal, and socioeconomic challenges and opportunities. It aims at making radical programmatic changes in the way traditional and non-traditional graduate students are trained. This crisis, which costs in work productivity, healthcare, and law enforcement expenses, requires interdisciplinary research to efficiently collect and assemble data, possibly from diverse sources, and analyze it to extract actionable information while being conscious of contextual factors, such as a consumer's health history, potential criminal record, personal background, and individual data security and privacy. The data aspects of this societal problem pose significant challenges on its collection, e.g., non-invasive sensing, and its secure and privacy-aware data analytics, which are the main research lines of this proposal. The project's students will get practical and multidisciplinary training to prepare them as future skilled professionals in the rapidly growing area of applications of AI and secure networked sensing technologies. The proposed model combines project-based learning techniques, multidisciplinary programs, ethics, civic engagement, leadership, and professional development and dissemination initiatives. The educational model structure will allow students from seven interdisciplinary doctoral and four master's programs to participate in the activities.

Examples include foams, gels, and many biological materials. Due to the complexity of the objects under study, advances in soft materials research are becoming more challenging to achieve using traditional approaches. At the same time, there is a growing need to develop new soft materials designed to address pressing societal concerns, many of which are environment- and energy-related. The associated technology implementation landscapes are also complex from a policy perspective. They are particularly challenging to navigate for classically trained scientists working beyond the lab to provide technology solutions for society. These issues highlight critical gaps in how students are trained to undertake both discipline-centered soft materials research and to tackle societal issues associated with the products of such research. This NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) award will address these gaps by implementing a new graduate education model that equips trainees to leverage data-intensive strategies driven by machine-learning for soft materials research and positions them to make impactful contributions beyond the lab through science policy. The project will provide a unique training opportunity for an anticipated 50 Ph.D. students (20 NRT-funded) and 40 Master’s students to develop and exercise a new paradigm for tackling high complexity soft materials research and understanding societal implications of technology through science policy. In addition, the project will build a robust and vibrant community of scholars working within a network of internal and external mentors. The project’s investigators aim to graduate leaders in academia, industry, and government, where the ability to harness data and integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines is critical. 

Two objectives guide the project’s traineeship experiences: (1) help students effectively harness data-intensive strategies to facilitate breakthroughs in complex soft material systems and (2) enable students to integrate information from multiple disciplines and the combined effects from multiple system responses, to effectively confront vexing scientific and societal challenges. The first objective is being met through a trans-disciplinary research approach entailing the convergence of Computer Science (machine learning; data science) and Autonomous Experimentation with the traditional inter-disciplinary approaches (Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Biology) currently used to study soft materials. The second objective is being attained through formal training and experiential learning in science policy to equip students with tools (e.g., thought processes, teamwork, transdisciplinary approaches) to thrive in convergence research and effectively address important societal issues involving science and technology. This NRT project encompasses three major research areas: Autonomous Experimentation, Colloidal and Macromolecular Materials, and Living Soft Materials. Potential contributions include the advancement of data-intensive methodologies, autonomous experimentation as a mode of discovery in soft materials research, and the development of new concepts at the interface of information theory, control theory, and materials science. The project will implement a custom-designed trans-disciplinary curriculum and associated certificate program that use best practices to monitor and evaluate academic outcomes that are responsive to trainees and other stakeholders.

Depression is one of the top mental health concerns among undergraduates. Recent research has established that aspects of scientific research experiences can exacerbate depressive symptoms. However, it is unknown what aspects of research that exacerbate depression are most commonly experienced by students or which aspects of research are most detrimental to student mental health. This CAREER project will address these gaps in the literature using interview and survey studies. Additionally, the project will develop brief, self-guided online interventions designed to help undergraduate and graduate researchers productively cope with challenges in research that can worsen mental health. This project will integrate research and teaching by developing biology education course-based undergraduate research experiences that will be offered to students enrolled in Arizona State University’s online life sciences Bachelor of Science degree programs. Online students will engage in authentic research activities focused on the relationship between science education and depression.

The goal of this project is to use an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design to examine the relationship between scientific research and depressive symptoms among undergraduate and graduate students in the life sciences. Additionally, the project aims to develop and evaluate single-session interventions to help undergraduate and graduate students cope with aspects of scientific research that can exacerbate depressive symptoms. Specifically, exploratory interview studies will further probe why biology undergraduate and graduate students perceive that aspects of research exacerbate, and sometimes alleviate, depressive symptoms, as well as identify moderators of the relationship between research and student depression. These studies will also explore potential targets for creating more inclusive research environments. The findings from the interviews will inform national survey studies to assess the relationship between research and depression among biology undergraduate and graduate students at scale and what approaches undergraduate and graduate researchers perceive would be most effective in transforming research spaces to be more inclusive. The results of these studies will be used to develop single-session interventions to help students cope with common challenges in research; the interventions will be easy to administer, independent of instructors or mentors, freely available, and deliverable to students at scale. To integrate research and teaching with the intent to build a foundational body of research on the relationship between science education and depression, and to normalize mental health concerns among students, biology education course-based undergraduate research experiences will be developed and taught to students in Arizona State University’s online life sciences Bachelor of Science degree programs. This approach will deliver authentic research experiences to a population of students who have very few research opportunities and who often report higher rates of depression than their peers completing degrees in person. Funding for this award is being provided by the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education program and the NSF Research Traineeship program in recognition of the alignment of the project with the aims of these two programs that focus on the undergraduate and graduate STEM education enterprises, respectively.

The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a National Science Foundation-wide activity that offers awards in support of early-career faculty who can serve as academic role models in research and education and lead advances in the mission of their department or organization. Chemists have played a significant role in solving some of the world's greatest issues and improving the quality of life for all people. Often, this requires that chemists be trained with advanced skills and knowledge only achievable through the completion of a doctoral degree program (Ph.D.). Significant concerns have been raised both inside and out of the chemistry community related to the ability of American chemistry doctoral programs to prepare their students effectively for future careers and scientific endeavors. These shortcomings in doctoral training indicate that the current system is training chemists whose preparation to tackle the world's next grand challenges could be improved. As such, this project will investigate the training of doctoral chemistry students from the faculty perspective to complement existing research that describes student perspectives. The elements used to progress a student from beginning to end of the Ph.D. program are well-known and homogeneous. This project will unearth the specific rationale for how these elements are supposed to develop an independent scientist and identify the specific roles faculty advisors play. Additionally, funding for this project will be used to prompt significant reforms in the graduate programs in five chemistry departments. It is expected that all chemistry graduate programs will gain access to resources that guide potential reforms through this project. These reforms are expected to improve the quality of scientists produced by chemistry doctoral programs for the betterment of society.

Three objectives guide this project. The first will build a model that describes how the Ph.D. student develops into an independent scientist based on faculty advisors' stated goals and learning outcomes. Chemistry faculty will be interviewed to discover each core element's role(s) in a typical chemistry doctoral program. From thematic analyses, a model of doctoral education will be constructed and modified/validated by chemistry faculty. Activities in Objective 2 will discover the chemistry faculty's specific values and beliefs pertaining to the training of doctoral chemistry students. This important research will reveal the faculty advisors' goals, roles, and identities and how they affect the training chemistry doctoral students receive. These beliefs are expected to be heavily influential in the practices that are observed in doctoral education. Finally, Objective 3 will develop resources that outline the primary issues with current Ph.D. training and what reforms have been suggested to mitigate them. These resources will be distributed to all chemistry graduate programs across the country. Additionally, the PI will work closely with five specific chemistry departments with the explicit aim of achieving tangible reform in how each trains chemistry doctoral students. This attempt to engage in specific reform aims to produce a generation of chemists that are more prepared for the challenges they will face in their careers.

This CAREER project aims to explore the beliefs, experiences, educational training, and research that supports the development of effective engineering education leaders who are assuming roles focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Advancing equity and broadening the participation of historically marginalized populations in engineering remain a priority for sustaining U.S. global leadership and economic progress. DEI initiatives, programs, and research are increasing in number across the country in an effort to better understand and dismantle the challenges. However, many DEI efforts are developed in isolation and are not supported by strong institutional commitment and policy. Results from this work will advance understanding of DEI issues, approaches, and effective institutional implementation and will prepare the next generation of DEI leaders to promote long-term, sustainable racial equity initiatives.

Three primary objectives guide this research effort. First, is to understand DEI leaders’ perceptions, knowledge, and challenges around their roles. Second is to examine the extent to which those perceptions compare and contrast with graduate students and early career faculty members from groups who have been historically underrepresented in their participation in STEM fields of study. Third, is to develop training and faculty development programs to prepare the next generation of DEI leaders. Data will be collected in the first phase of the project by conducting interviews with DEI leaders at multiple institutions and contrasting their experiences with a document analysis of institutional DEI programs, policies, awards, and incentives. In a subsequent phase the project will use a survey, based on results from phase one, to examine the beliefs and practices of engineering faculty members and graduate students from groups historically marginalized in engineering. Training and faculty development are the focus of phase three, which includes the preparation of senior PhD students and early-career faculty members in engineering not only for DEI positions, but also for research, teaching, mentoring, and enhancing student understanding of DEI issues.

Tackling society’s grand challenges will require a workforce that is prepared to work to integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines, to work as a team, and to leverage the intellectual contributions of all Americans. However, employers often find that graduate students entering the workforce lack interdisciplinary training and an appreciation for data science. These scenarios necessitate new designs of STEM graduate education programs that promote interdisciplinary team building, integration of data science in solution methodologies, and exposure of graduate students to multicultural work environments. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to The University of Akron (UA) will support the first such traineeship program in Northeast Ohio for masters and doctoral students working at the interface of materials science and machine learning that will lead to the discovery of new materials and major advances in materials research. The traineeship will serve 40 M.S. and Ph.D. students including 20 funded M.S. and Ph.D. students recruited from all backgrounds and enrolled in graduate programs in polymer science and polymer engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science.

This NRT program seeks to identify and mitigate the knowledge gaps while providing data-driven answers for several cross-disciplinary research questions that are of interest to the broad materials research community. Examples include i) the tunability of a material modulus with temperature and the quality consistency of composite parts produced via additive manufacturing, ii) the dynamics of ions and mechanisms of ion transport in crystalline polymer domains as in batteries, iii) the molecular design of chemically recyclable polymers with tunable thermal and mechanical properties; iv) novel feature selection techniques in current machine learning tools to handle data from large complex polymeric systems; and v) efficient and systematic integration of large-scale heterogeneous data from multiple sources. The research will utilize a combination of experimental and numerical approaches, including molecular dynamics simulation, finite element analysis, polymer chemistry synthesis, additive manufacturing techniques and machine learning tools, to achieve the desired objectives. This project will create a scalable materials database that is integrable with existing polymer repositories and can be used to develop novel composite materials, molecular design rules for solid electrolytes with superior conductivity, and the design of new polymer materials that can be efficiently recycled.  The trainees will develop strong interdisciplinary skills via courses and research work, workshops and seminars, laboratory rotations, internships at federal and industrial laboratories, and international exposure. They will receive a Data Science Engineering graduate certificate and are expected to become strong proponents of digitalization tools in materials research. The trainees will also take part in outreach and mentoring activities at high schools and two-year colleges to enhance participation in STEM fields.

This model will co-develop research projects suitable for trainee teams to tackle using Machine Learning (ML) methods. Stakeholders include government agencies on all levels, non-governmental organizations, and community groups, with a common goal to improve the resiliency of Gulf Coast communities and environment. STAGES will provide a curricular foundation for convergent environmental science that is data intensive, starting each spring with coursework and a week-long field trip to experience the interaction of land-water-atmospheric events firsthand. Late Spring Stakeholder Workshops pair trainees and stakeholders to formulate data-focused research questions. Summer Big Data Blitzes prepare trainees for team efforts to answer questions, culminating in Fall Capstones to refine and communicate research results. Trainees will benefit from an interdisciplinary cadre of deeply experienced faculty researchers with extensive field, data science, and student training experience. Anticipated findings are expected to include best practices for engaging stakeholders to identify data-intensive challenges and co-develop research questions; assimilation of the challenges by trainees with various backgrounds; and identification of problems appropriate for the trainees' different fields of study. During the training process, trainees will become better science communicators who can engage stakeholders and grasp the ethical dimensions of their decisions for long-term collaborations. STAGES will establish and disseminate transformative STEM training, research, and evaluation advances in coastal and marine system science that produce a sustainable and scalable graduate education model.

Global food supply and food security are at risk due to an increasing world population, climate change, diminishing natural resources, and limited available land. In agriculture, the primary challenge has been how to be more productive with less - less arable land, less water, less labor, less certainty. In arid lands, these challenges are amplified. Agricultural systems struggle to cope with rapid changes in water availability and land-use patterns, scarcity of labor due to declining population, variability and uncertainty related to changing weather and climate, and aging rural infrastructures. Arid lands and drylands, which cover much of the Western US, are expected to expand as the climate changes. Artificial intelligence (AI) can bring a paradigm shift in how the twin economic and environmental challenges of farming and ranching in arid lands can be addressed. AI can support farmers to operate with greater efficiency and precision through the assistance of autonomous systems (e.g., drones, ground vehicles, and intelligent irrigation systems) and the support of intelligent software systems to aid in decision making (e.g., detecting and resolving crop diseases). AI-driven solutions will not only enable farmers to do more with less; they will also improve quality and ensure a faster path-to-market for crops and livestock. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to New Mexico State University (NMSU) will enable the creation of a coordinated graduate training program, called Artificial Intelligence for Arid Land Agriculture (AIALA), to prepare the next generation of scholars and practitioners by teaching graduate students how to bridge the divides between AI and Agriculture for Arid Lands. The project anticipates training 33 MS and Ph.D. students, including 18 funded trainees, from computing-related disciplines and agriculture-related disciplines.

The AIALA scholar experience will integrate with and complement the traditional graduate disciplinary training, thus contextualizing the in-depth disciplinary research for researchers in either AI or agriculture-related areas. Moreover, the experience will allow scholars to effectively serve as catalysts in research teams using AI to solve arid land challenges. The research conducted by the AIALA scholars and their research mentors will advance the state of the art in both AI and Arid Land Agriculture. The research will promote the creation of novel multi-agent systems frameworks, advancing the state of the art in machine learning and distributed data analytics. In addition, it will provide methodologies and technologies to enhance the adaptability of crops, rangeland plants and livestock, improve the resiliency of livestock in expansive rugged rangelands, and ultimately lead to resilient and sustainable arid land agricultural systems. The AIALA training model benefits from a number of innovations. First, it establishes a transdisciplinary training pipeline, embedding AI research challenges in Arid Land Agricultural challenges, enabling contextualized and situated learning. Second, it integrates graduate students and faculty mentors in mutually supportive teams of learners, supported, in turn, by an extensive mentoring infrastructure. Third, it infuses welcoming practices into all operations and learning activities, promoting engagement and collaboration among scholars from a wide variety of backgrounds. Finally, it emphasizes the development of professional skills as part of holistic disciplinary training.

The modern study of biology is increasingly digital. Ever-expanding databases of genome sequences, protein structures, electronic health records, and biometric data may hold the key for solving crucial problems in many domains, such as biomedicine, agriculture, ecology, and forensics. Gathering useful information from this data requires advanced computer science skills as well as a deep understanding of biology. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Rutgers University-Camden will meet this national need by training Master’s and doctoral degree students in the fundamental biology and biophysics of DNA and proteins, artificial intelligence (AI) methods, and professional best practices for team software development. The traineeship follows a new model for students and faculty mentors that combines innovative training support with increased expectations. While the program is designed to make science graduate training of any discipline more efficient, effective, and accessible, the NRT is specifically designed to overcome the challenges in training students in new fields between traditional domains of expertise. The project anticipates training 30 M.S. and 25 Ph.D. students, with an additional 300 M.S. and Ph.D. students expected to participate in a subset of the activities. Trainees will graduate with a combination of skills that are highly in-demand across academic, government, and industrial workplaces.

The research and training activities of this NRT award are particularly focused on using AI and sustainably developed software to overcome the widening communication gap between genomicists and proteomicists. This communication gap, worsened by diverging scientific dialects, has prevented the synthesis of research advances and the development of new unifying biological principles. AI is a generalizable approach that is being increasingly used by both fields. Software is a powerful method for communication and bridging disciplinary divides. However, it must be accessible to both disciplines and developed to a standard that academic software rarely meets. The team proposes a new model for graduate training that combines evidenced-based methods, redesigned for improved sustainability, and original activities that satisfy an identified need. Training activities will include revised curricula, the introduction of efficient “just-in-time” short format high-quality training, an industry mentorship program integrated with the trainee’s research, and peer mentoring for expanding perspectives and sharing strategies. The traineeship will introduce the new “Codes for Life” track into an interdisciplinary graduate degree program at Rutgers University-Camden. Many activities will be extended to all students enrolled in this broad graduate program. As a result, this will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate activities with a large graduate student body without historical departmental constraints.

A well-prepared workforce is essential to fulfilling this promise. In response to this critical workforce need, this National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the Colorado School of Mines (Mines) and San Jose State University (SJSU) supports the development of rigorous, integrated, interdisciplinary training programs preparing both Master’s and Doctoral students for careers in QIST. The program has three components that address key challenges in training a quantum workforce. First, new training materials will be developed to introduce QIST basics to students from different disciplines. Trainees will come from physics, electrical engineering, metallurgical and materials engineering, applied mathematics and statistics, computer science, and quantum engineering. Second, industrial and national lab partners will be engaged to provide trainees access to cutting-edge technologies and research experiences. Finally, student recruitment and mentoring programs, unconscious bias training, ally workshops, and regular climate surveys will be developed to ensure diversity in the QIST workforce. The project will train one-hundred and twenty-five (125) MS and Ph.D. students, including thirty-five (35) fully-funded trainees. These efforts will result in an institutionalized program that produces leaders in QIST for careers in academia, industry, government, and national labs. 

The research program addresses three grand challenges in quantum technology: (1) How can demonstrable quantum speed-up using existing or near-term quantum computing architectures be achieved? (2) How can materials and electrical engineering interface with quantum technology to provide meaningful advances in device development and fabrication? (3) How can new directions in quantum algorithms advance and challenge the notion that quantum technology can solve problems that are impossible to tackle with conventional technology? These interdisciplinary research challenges require close synergy between fundamental physics, materials science, electrical engineering, and algorithm development. New courses and degree pathways in QIST are being developed at both Mines and SJSU, which include integration of professional skills development into the graduate curriculum. Through classroom training and research, trainees will be exposed to the full range of quantum technology architectures, providing a holistic view of this rapidly developing field. An innovative educational agreement between Mines and SJSU will provide opportunities for students to complete an MS/Ph.D. bridge program from SJSU to Mines. The program will result in a template for QIST graduate education, which will be accessible to STEM students from all backgrounds and types of institutions, increasing diversity in QIST.

Current generation packaging materials are made of polymer composites that are derived from petroleum sources. These materials are not degradable and either end up in landfills or are incinerated, releasing toxic gases. Factors such as greater environmental awareness, societal concerns, and the depletion of petrochemical resources collectively drive a desire to develop new materials and products based on plant fibers and degradable biopolymers. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Tuskegee University will establish a multidisciplinary traineeship in Sustainable Nanobiomaterials. The program is a partnership between three doctoral programs to collaboratively develop innovative sustainable biomaterials for biodegradable packaging systems, including biomedical and food packaging. The project anticipates training 40 students (30 Ph.D. and 10 Masters), including 30 funded trainees, from Materials Science and Engineering, Integrative Biosciences, and Integrative Pathobiology. The Tuskegee NRT effort will produce a large number of minority graduates, including a significant number of women with Ph.D. degrees in STEM. An area of focus for the traineeship includes support and training of faculty to mentor the trainees and provide trainees with training and opportunities to mentor as well. These graduates will become excellent role models for many young students and help bring much-needed diversity to the nation’s advanced technological workforce in Sustainable Nanobiomaterials.

The multidisciplinary project team will train emerging scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and managers to develop the next generation of sustainable, biodegradable food and medical packaging applications. The trainees will carry out research in: (a) Synthesis of calcium and silica-based nanoparticles from waste resources such as bone ash, fish scales, egg and seashells, (b) Antimicrobial functionalization of nanoparticles and short plant fibers using green synthesis methods, (c) Structural, morphological, and spectral characterization of as-prepared nanoparticles, (d) Fabrication of antimicrobial polymer packaging films using polymer blow films, 3D printing, and solution casting, (e) Nanomechanical, structural, morphological, and thermal characterization of as-prepared polymer composite films, and (f) Antimicrobial inhibition, product design, prototyping, biodegradability, and commercial feasibility studies. The knowledge and training gained by the trainees will eventually result in new design and manufacturing methodologies. The program emphasizes mentoring at three levels. Students will be co-advised and mentored by a minimum of two faculty members. Faculty and trainees will be involved in outreach to and mentoring of high school students. Moreover, an annual mentoring workshop will be conducted to provide both faculty and trainees with strategies for effective mentoring. Other professional development activities are also in place to ensure students receive formal and informal preparation in proposal development and technical writing, teamwork, and ethics.

Despite their importance, many river systems are highly contaminated with toxins, sediment, nutrients, and metals. Contamination originates from many sources, including industrial activity, pesticide runoff, wastewater treatment discharges, and urban runoff. This contamination is considered an invisible water crisis posing serious risks for wildlife and human health in many places. As this crisis escalates in watersheds, it impacts the communities living in these watersheds adversely. Therefore, it becomes important to train a new workforce capable of integrating scientific information, public policy, and the knowledge and concerns of affected social groups, including Native American tribes, for effective management of the resources of river systems. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the Washington State University will train graduate students from across the United States how to study challenges in rivers, watersheds, and communities as they relate to human and ecosystem health and will use the Columbia River Basin as the study site. The project anticipates training 65 master’s and doctoral degree students, including 25 funded trainees, from civil and environmental engineering, biological sciences, environmental and natural resources sciences, environmental sociology, and political science. Central to the traineeship is developing a community engagement approach that begins with the recognition that communities face diverse and complex issues and leverages knowledge of native communities to identify key problems and implement equitable solutions. Students participating in this program will engage with communities to co-produce solutions and opportunities to the invisible water crisis through scientific training, research, and problem-solving. 

This NRT program will integrate the natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, and traditional knowledges to develop a transdisciplinary research program in river-watershed-community systems that ultimately will produce equitable solutions to pressing, societal problems experienced by diverse communities. Program activities are focused on two education and training objectives aimed to: (1) cause a cultural shift in STEM graduate education by embracing transdisciplinary learning and the co-production of knowledge through community engagement, and (2) transform our STEM graduate training into a student-centered mentoring model. Education and research themes address basic and applied research questions related to water quality and landscape dynamics of river systems, anthropogenic changes in the environment that affect ecosystem health, and equitable mitigation of the cultural, economic, or health consequences experienced by communities. The traineeship program gives students the flexibility to pursue individualized research paths and provides hands-on training experiences to build skill and competency in communication, teamwork, ethics, cultural knowledge, traditional knowledges, transdisciplinarity, and quantitative/computational research methods. Program elements weave engagement experiences throughout the student experience in the form of novel courses, leadership training, a Columbia River Basin Living Atlas focused on data integration and visualization, and multi-media communication.

Soil, water, and air are essential resources. Their quality critically impacts society at a local and global scale in multiple ways, from farming productivity and food security to human and ecosystem health. The effective monitoring of factors affecting soil, water, and air quality requires the development of economical, multifunctional, durable, and easily deployable sensors. These sensors must also be highly sensitive to specific environmental properties or pollutants and able to capture both instantaneous events and long-term processes. Nanomaterials are ideal candidates for developing high-sensitivity sensors, as nano-engineering allows tuning of material properties at the atomic scale. These properties enable the development of highly specialized platforms for targeted application in specific environmental problems. This    National    Science    Foundation    Research    Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of California, Merced will develop a doctoral training program where convergent research will be driven by the goal of developing multifunctional nanomaterial-based environmental sensors. The project anticipates training 200 Ph.D. students, including 25 funded trainees from physics, chemistry, mechanical engineering, environmental science, and materials science and engineering, thereby creating a new generation of diverse and globally competitive nano-engineers.

The NRT Convergence of Nano-engineered Devices for Environmental and Sustainability Applications (CONDESA) program will create a new generation of nano-engineers by cross-training students in molecular biology, physics, chemistry, environmental science, and sustainable systems. The program goal is to create multifunctional, nano-engineered sensors for environmental media (air, soil, and water) and to demonstrate their application in real-world testbeds to assess and solve environmental health and sustainability problems. Monitoring complex, dynamic patterns (“hot spots” and “hot moments”) in environmental properties requires high-resolution sensing, spotlighting the need for low-cost, energy-efficient, nano-enabled sensors. These properties include chemical concentrations, states, and flows associated with pollution, biogeochemical cycling, and risks to human health and ecosystems. Nano-engineering and nanotechnology allow tuning of material properties at the most fundamental atomic scale, therefore making it possible to develop highly specialized platforms for targeted applications. To achieve rapid convergence on effective sensor designs, NRT CONDESA will engage physicists, environmental and materials scientists, and device engineers to collaboratively identify key applications and specifications, guide the choice of transduction and materials, and design an integrated system that is resilient to environmental conditions.

Public Abstract
The rapidly increasing cost of healthcare represents one of the most pressing problems facing the United States and most other countries around the world. At the same time, increased life expectancy has resulted in a significant expansion of the nation’s elderly population. The combination of rising health care costs and increased life spans poses tough challenges for many families. The widespread disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated these national challenges and health disparities, particularly in rural communities with poor health rankings. These problems could be addressed by new advances in digital health (DH) and how we train the next generation of scientists, engineers, and healthcare professionals to develop and deploy such advances. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to West Virginia University (WVU) will address these challenges by developing a new graduate education and traineeship model to prepare professionals who can work in collaborative transdisciplinary teams to develop and apply data science and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in addressing difficult problems in DH, including in rural areas. The project anticipates training twenty-four (24) funded and forty (40) unfunded MS and PhD students from different backgrounds, including engineering, computer science, medicine, health sciences, physical sciences, and economics.

Data science and AI techniques have been successfully applied to address a diverse range of health problems. The traineeship will address how to scale and build on DH successes by developing: 1) effective and transferable frameworks for training a larger and more diverse workforce with the foundations underlying these advances while inculcating soft skills beyond traditional coursework and ensuring rural communities are served; and 2) new ways to address other problems in DH related to the nature of DH data, the significant data analysis gap, and computational problems. A key element in the traineeship is its specific attention to the “bridges” required for effective and scalable traineeship and workforce development in DH. These bridges will connect: (a) different fields within health sciences, and across other areas, including barriers posed by the distinct terminologies used by different fields; (b) different scales of study in biomedicine (from micro to macro) via integration of different data types; and (c) underrepresented groups and innovative research in DH to ensure diversity in the traineeship. This diversity will be achieved by: 1) recruiting and supporting success for participants from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, those who are rural, those from the first generation in their families to go to college, and/or those from other groups underserved in STEM, and 2) by bridging Primarily Undergraduate Institutions and large research institutions. Trainees will develop novel approaches to tackle some of the core problems in AI (e.g., trust and safe decision making, scalable data structures, and attention-based information integration). Trainees will apply these approaches to specific problems in health, such as myocardial fingerprinting from echocardiograms and large-scale functional annotation in genomics. The project uses an innovative sequence of components to interweave the research theme, important professional skills (e.g., communication, ethics, leadership, collaboration), and coursework into the traineeship model without extending time-to-degree. Upon completion, trainees will be awarded a Certificate in DH. The traineeship will also form a basis for a new, transdisciplinary PhD program in DH at WVU.

This technology is largely based on standard American English and the misconception that there is a single, idealized variety of American English, which conflicts with the true diversity of language users. Many U.S. speakers use a regional variety of American English, African American Vernacular English, a signed language, a language other than English, or have some form of communication disorder. As the U.S. population is becoming older, age-related hearing loss and language impairments will also increase. The linguistic sophistication of technology has not kept pace with the growing linguistic diversity within the U.S.  This technology is intended to improve the lives of humans and society at large, and people increasingly depend on it for access to governmental, community, health, and educational services, making the technology’s current reliance on standard American English problematic. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to the Pennsylvania State University will educate a new generation of experts in human-technology interactions to address this issue. The project anticipates training 48 graduate students, including 23 funded trainees, from graduate programs in Psychology, German, Spanish, Communication Science and Disorders, Computer Science and Engineering, Information Sciences and Technology, and Learning Design and Technology. The comprehensive two-year traineeships will prepare trainees to address key challenges in human-technology interactions. Improvements in human-technology interactions will help ensure the full participation of individuals with diverse language backgrounds, fostering a productive society for the 21st century.

By applying integrated learning and transdisciplinary team science principles, trainees will be prepared to bridge the gap between language science and technology.

This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Stony Brook University (the State University of New York at Stony Brook) will prepare a diverse pool of students to become fluent in both data sciences and human-centered sciences. The program will enable students to conduct convergent research in problem domains that blend data science with deep disciplinary knowledge. The project anticipates training sixty-eight (68) Ph.D. students, including thirty-four (34) NRT-funded trainees, recruited from both the human-centered sciences (HCS, consisting of Psychology, Linguistics, Economics, Neurobiology & Behavior, Political Science, and Sociology) and the data sciences (DS, consisting of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics & Statistics). In the U.S., scientifically oriented domestic students tend to gather in distinct siloes, with significantly higher proportions of women in HCS than in DS fields. HCS students are well-trained in the traditional empirical methods of their fields. However, many do not identify as ""data scientists."" These HCS students may lack the preparation to dive into graduate coursework in computer science to acquire cutting-edge research skills in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data that could empower their research. And many DS students lack a deep theoretical and practical understanding of how datasets are collected and their limitations. Moreover, DS students may lack the skills to assess the impacts of data-based technology upon human beings and society. 

In this two-pathway training model, DS trainees will take graduate coursework in an HCS domain, earning a certificate in the Human-Centered Sciences. Meanwhile, HCS trainees will take any needed intensive bridge courses to prepare them for graduate coursework in DS and earn an Artificial Intelligence certificate. Trainees will come together in three team-taught research practica centered on a relevant and inclusive theme: bias—in data, in humans, and in institutions. These practica will focus on discovering how the use of powerful quantitative methods can camouflage biases (both implicit and explicit) that, in a given context, advantage some human beings and disadvantage others. Both trainees and trainers will practice techniques for detecting and addressing biases in themselves and their research, as well as within social and institutional settings. Together, they will join convergent research collaborations that target pervasive problems of inequity and the ethical uses of technology.

Combining these data from the Internet of Things, and drawing on techniques for analyzing them through Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), is now considered crucial for progress in all sectors. Digital transformation is the staple of multiple sectors of industry and commerce. However, more far-reaching consequences of digital transformation for poverty alleviation, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and, more generally, improving outcomes for under-resourced or low-income populations are understudied. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of California-Berkeley will allow us to provide interdisciplinary training for our students in design methodologies, algorithms, and problem-solving approaches to substantively analyze, ethically investigate, and develop verifiable, fair, inclusive, and useful observations from datasets and models. From these insights, students will be able to devise and deploy digital tools to accelerate growth for low-income populations in the U.S. and globally. The project anticipates training 100 master’s and doctoral students, including 28 NRT-funded trainees, from any degree program at the university that expresses interest in researching digital transformation of development (DToD). A key concern has been how the analytics and other mechanisms developed using big data benefit the populations surveyed. By ensuring that the analytic techniques and algorithms, privacy, fairness, mechanism design, and implementation of digital technology are relevant to under-served populations, the DToD traineeship also expects to increase diversity and inclusion of members of underrepresented minority groups in STEM.

The DToD program will include interdisciplinary research activities, formal coursework and curriculum building, immersive lab and field training, the creation of official DToD concentrations at both the doctoral and master’s degree levels, and career development. In addition, the program’s effectiveness in developing critical skillsets for multinational workforces will be assessed through formative evaluation. The program will rely on both interdisciplinary research faculty and development practitioners in three broad application areas: (1) Measures for Alleviating Poverty with Data, Algorithms, and AI Applied to Policy; (2) Poverty Interventions that Integrate the Natural and Built Environments in Low-Resource Settings; and (3) Improving Health and Wellbeing in Low-Income Populations. DToD will also contribute to the development of shared public datasets aligned with  national strategies and priorities related to advancing AI.

Coastal environments throughout the world are undergoing substantial changes in response to climate and human-induced disturbances. Natural disasters and climate stressors make already pervasive inequities and environmental injustices in coastal communities even more pronounced.  Therefore, there is an imperative for a workforce that can investigate how coastal regions are changing in response to human and natural stressors. The resulting science can then be translated to aid communities in assessing the risks of, and actions to address, these challenges.  A variety of agencies and stakeholders routinely collect environmental and socio-economic data that could help to address these problems. However, the data required for traditional analyses or modeling approaches are rarely collected. Therefore, understanding the drivers of coastal change requires creative ways to make sense of available diverse data sets. Trainees in the Coastal Community Environmental Data Scholars (CCEDS) program will represent multiple graduate degree programs and undertake activities that train them in how to apply data science skills while building their confidence as data science scholars – an important issue as many students coming from backgrounds like geology or biology may see data science as a barrier to success rather than a pathway to career enablement. The trainees will extend their dissertation research by applying their basic science skills in partnerships with local communities to identify and solve problems of concern. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to East Carolina University (ECU) will train interdisciplinary scientists and engineers to address problems of critical importance to coastal communities via data science. The project anticipates training 36 Ph.D. students, including 18 funded trainees, from two of ECU’s flagship doctoral programs, the Integrated Coastal Science program and the Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Biology, Biomedicine, and Chemistry. 

Data-driven tools like empirical dynamical modeling and deep learning have an advantage over traditional modeling and analysis methods when insufficient information is available to develop mechanistic models of environmental processes and their coupling with human activities.  These data-driven tools can bring new insights to the understanding of complex systems, particularly in detecting changes in system behavior that can be complemented with more traditional studies to understand why or how the change occurred.  The proposed traineeship supports research activities focused on the convergence of two distinct Ph.D. programs and ensures the preparation of an interdisciplinary data science workforce, especially important for economically developing coastal regions.  Trainees will build on their data science experience by taking part in a 2-year sequence of six program activities involving practices supporting convergent research, science communication, and community-engaged research. Further, the traineeship is based on and tests the effectiveness of best practices for training students to overcome issues such as imposter phenomena and stereotype threats related to data science. The experiential activities are structured to build trainees’ confidence and identity while preparing them for real-world data science jobs within and beyond academia.  This program will benefit society by training a diverse workforce to collaborate with community partners and use data-driven activities to mitigate environmental issues that impact equity and social justice in coastal regions.

With the discovery of gravitational waves, there is a new window on the universe and with it, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to launch a new field. The goal of this program is to pilot the Establishing Multimessenger Astronomy Inclusive Training (EMIT) initiative. EMIT will be a transdisciplinary graduate program that promotes diversity and inclusion and produces scholars with the skills needed to drive discoveries in MMA while expanding the STEM workforce. The project will train 300 students from physics, astronomy, math, and engineering, including 19 funded trainees, through new formal curricula, seminars, summer programs, and research. The aim is to build a community of practice that is diverse from the outset through cohort building, shared research experiences, visible underrepresented minority role models, and a suite of evidence-based programming designed to promote inclusive excellence.
 
EMIT trainees will learn the interdisciplinary concepts, research techniques, and the conduct of research critical to advance MMA. Using educational research-supported practices, the program will prepare students to take a team science approach while developing transferable skills for transition to the workforce. Some trainees will earn a Master of Science degree at Fisk University, a collaborating institution, and may directly enter employment or go on to join a Ph.D. program. Other trainees will enter Vanderbilt directly in a doctoral program. Regardless of the option chosen, students will earn a graduate certificate in MMA through research, coursework, and outreach. Joint student research between Fisk, Vanderbilt, and external collaborators will bring together new nodes of expertise. These collaborative research projects will complement and enhance the strengths of the partnering institutions. The team will provide stage-specific professional development for the entire student training period.  The program supplements traditional coursework with a novel modular curriculum specific to MMA. Some courses and Blast Modules will be posted on an EMIT YouTube channel to reach the larger community. A summer workshop, open nationally, will occur every other year and broaden understanding of the research needs, promote the skills required for MMA, and further stimulate teaching and communication for EMIT trainees. After earning the graduate certificate, EMIT trainees will help lead this workshop.

AI’s ethical and societal implications must be considered as systems are designed, developed, and deployed. The increasingly ubiquitous adoption of robots in homes and cities is poised to transform our society.  However, it remains an open question whether this technology will develop in a way that increases the divide between haves and have-nots or results in a more just and equitable society. Thus, there is a need for convergent STEM graduate education to ensure that future roboticists are prepared to consider ethical implications of robotics technology and build a more just and equitable future for everyone. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Texas at Austin will address the challenge of integrating responsible and ethical AI at all stages of development, design, and deployment of service robots. The Convergent, Responsible, and Ethical AI Training Experience for Roboticists (CREATE Roboticists) program will integrate ethical robotics education, research, and career development. The program will train 32 funded trainees and 150 additional graduate students from the Departments of Aerospace, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering, and Schools of Architecture, Information, and Public Affairs.

CREATE Roboticists will train future roboticists who: (i) understand the ethical implications of service robots and can develop new theories, methods, and techniques to satisfy ethical requirements; (ii) design human-centered ethical service robots that respect human autonomy and ethical values; and (iii) develop robotics policy informed by cutting edge convergent research. This program includes six elements: coursework, research opportunities, mentorship, professional development, internships, and public service.

A well-prepared workforce is essential to fulfilling this promise. In response to this critical workforce need, this National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the Colorado School of Mines (Mines) and San Jose State University (SJSU) supports the development of rigorous, integrated, interdisciplinary training programs preparing both Master’s and Doctoral students for careers in QIST. The program has three components that address key challenges in training a quantum workforce. First,  new training materials will be developed to introduce QIST basics to students from different disciplines. Trainees will come from physics, electrical engineering, metallurgical and materials engineering, applied mathematics and statistics, computer science, and quantum engineering. Second, industrial and national lab partners will be engaged to provide trainees access to cutting-edge technologies and research experiences. Finally, student recruitment and mentoring programs, unconscious bias training, ally workshops, and regular climate surveys will be developed to ensure diversity in the QIST workforce. The project will train one-hundred and twenty-five (125) MS and Ph.D. students, including thirty-five (35) fully-funded trainees. These efforts will result in an institutionalized program that produces leaders in QIST for careers in academia, industry, government, and national labs.

The research program addresses three grand challenges in quantum technology: (1) How can demonstrable quantum speed-up using existing or near-term quantum computing architectures be achieved? (2) How can materials and electrical engineering interface with quantum technology to provide meaningful advances in device development and fabrication? (3) How can new directions in quantum algorithms advance and challenge the notion that quantum technology can solve problems that are impossible to tackle with conventional technology? These interdisciplinary research challenges require close synergy between fundamental physics, materials science, electrical engineering, and algorithm development. New courses and degree pathways in QIST are being developed at both Mines and SJSU, which include integration of professional skills development into the graduate curriculum. Through classroom training and research, trainees will be exposed to the full range of quantum technology architectures, providing a holistic view of this rapidly developing field. An innovative educational agreement between Mines and SJSU will provide opportunities for students to complete an MS/Ph.D. bridge program from SJSU to Mines. The program will result in a template for QIST graduate education, which will be accessible to STEM students from all backgrounds and types of institutions, increasing diversity in QIST.

Temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global average. Dramatic sea ice reductions, significant glacier and ice sheet mass loss, and rapidly thawing permafrost impact Arctic peoples’ and ecosystems’ daily activities and well-being. Many of the most profound changes result from shifts in seasonality—the timing of cultural, biological, physical, and chemical events—especially the nature and timing of spring and autumn. Addressing how changing  seasonality across the Arctic affects ecosystems, the built environment, and human communities requires the convergence of many disciplines capable of recognizing the interlinked challenges posed by climate change. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of New Hampshire (UNH) will train graduate students to use a convergence research framework to investigate and understand the interwoven impacts of changing seasonality on Arctic natural and human systems.

For example, future engineers will create intelligent surgical instruments, autonomous robots that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to make clinical decisions, and tools that augment the performance and capabilities of surgeons. This will require a convergence of skillsets and knowledge to traverse technological, regulatory, ethical, and societal hurdles to create technologies that safely and successfully meet modern challenges. Most graduate engineering programs excel at teaching the fundamental tenets of their respective disciplines. However, graduate engineering curricula often lack the training that enables students to transcend their disciplines and engage in convergent research that involves not just other engineers, but also professionals from other STEM fields, medicine, business, and law. By engaging with these other disciplines, this traineeship will provide a more holistic and innovative approach for the professional formation of engineers to impact the future of advanced surgical technologies.   This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Duke University will train Master’s and Ph.D. students in the interdisciplinary fields of engineering, computer science, data science, and surgical technologies.  This project anticipates training a total of 230 students, including 30 NRT-funded trainees from Engineering, Computer Science, Math, Science and Society, and Statistics. The vision for this traineeship is to provide a new research and training framework for engineering and computer science graduate students to access other disciplines and thereby design advanced surgical technologies that integrate medical provider, societal, end-user, and patient needs throughout development and testing.

The proposed traineeship model combines classroom-based, research-based, and professional development activities completed concurrently over two years, leading to four core learning outcomes: (1) a common knowledge base; (2) subject expertise across multiple, convergent disciplines; (3) a translational experience at the forefront of surgical technology research and development; and (4) professional development opportunities that prepare students for both academic and industry-based careers in surgical technology. A specific novelty of the proposed program is the use of topical primers interconnected with mini design challenges in which trainees will shadow a surgeon, use current surgical tools and robots, and take knowledge primers in robotics, surgery, machine learning, rapid prototyping, ethics, intellectual property, and medical law; these activities are designed to enable students to acquire a diverse knowledge base and necessary  professional development quickly. Trainees will also receive feedback from stakeholders such as surgeons and external board members from industry to provide further professional development.

The program's goal is to train a new generation of biological scientists and engineers who can work across disciplines, are fluent in data analytics and experimental methods, and who will advance fundamental research in quantitative biology and bioengineering. Cell and developmental biology are in transition from qualitative observational sciences to quantitative, data-rich fields that leverage modeling and design principles from physics and engineering. Advances in imaging and sequencing technologies, paired with machine learning and computer vision tools, are having a transformative impact on quantitative cell biology. To take full advantage of these technologies, the modern biological engineer needs to be fluent both in the design of biological experiments and in data mining strategies to integrate information across scales (temporal and from genetic/molecular to cellular and tissue scales). DDB seeks to provide students with the breadth to collaborate across disciplines meaningfully and with the depth to answer biological questions with scientific rigor supported by knowledge of and experience with data science approaches. The project anticipates training 70 Ph.D. students, including 30 funded trainees, from doctoral programs in: biological engineering, biomolecular science & engineering, chemical engineering, computer science, electrical and computer engineering, molecular, cellular and developmental biology, mechanical engineering, and physics. 

Through DDB, students will learn how to design experiments; acquire and integrate multi-modal, disparate data; and integrate machine learning and computational approaches to extract patterns and meaning from biological data to understand and leverage heterogeneity in stem-cell-derived models. Trainees will be supported by a new curriculum, which will serve as the basis of an emergent Biological Engineering Ph.D. program. Onboarding will include a structured course on seminal research papers and best practices for designing interdisciplinary inquiry. Armed with these training elements, students will be immersed in an in-vivo research experience to conduct hands-on redesign of seminal experiments and to personally implement advanced research methods to test the conclusions of these seminal papers. Students will also engage in co-mentored research rotation projects across diverse labs (experimental and modeling). To support self-reflection, deliberate career planning, and self-efficacy, the program will deploy a three-pronged mentoring plan, including a faculty advisor, peer feedback, and self-assessment through individual development plans. Finally, internships and externships will provide trainees with immersive exchange opportunities across a research network committed to convergent and translational training. This will allow students to experience firsthand how fundamental discovery can ultimately impact applied health applications.

This NRT aims to educate researchers capable of “co-designing” AI algorithms and work systems to unlock new opportunities in both the capabilities of new systems and their “trustworthiness.” To accomplish this, the educational program aims to instill the following: 1) Comfort in bridging distant disciplines. Through novel onboarding sequences and shared experience of cross-disciplinary engagement with peers, mentors, and industry, the program will educate interdisciplinary, “comb-shaped” scholars who have a solid base in either AI algorithms or work system design and are also comfortable engaging deeply with other disciplinary areas fundamental to their chosen research problems. 2) Appreciation for contextually-embedded problem-solving. Important issues arise when well-intentioned systems evolve post-deployment. The NRT emphasizes context early and often as research is being formulated. Summer bootcamps will facilitate research problem formulation that enables early cycles of feedback and testing with a broad set of stakeholders. Additionally, by intertwining students from different programs by engaging them in a professional certificate through the onboarding sequences, informal opportunities will be created for natural cross-pollination from theory to practice and back. 3) Holistic professional identities. Although many Ph.D. programs are starting to build scaffolding to support “soft-skills,” this usually occurs separately from core program elements. This program’s strategy is to make communication, leadership, teamwork, and ethics central to each program element. The bootcamps and seminars will also provide structured opportunities for students to learn, practice, and reinforce their strategies, e.g., engaging with ethics in context. 4) Valuing diverse perspectives in decision-making. AI algorithms tend to exacerbate existing biases, making it especially important to bring diverse perspectives into decision-making to mitigate unintended consequences. Currently, AI adoption is being driven by a relatively homogenous group. There is a need to increase participation from underrepresented groups and expose students to the value of bringing in diverse perspectives early in the process.

As a result, they have widespread impact on many aspects of both engineered and natural systems including agriculture, industry, and human health. Extreme environments provide unique opportunities to conduct cross-cutting transformative science. Their reduced biodiversity and extreme physical and chemical conditions enable detailed characterization and quantitative descriptions of important physical, chemical, and biological processes. This National Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Montana State University (MSU) will train a diverse group of Ph.D. students to effectively engage and understand critical properties of extreme biofilm systems across multiple disciplines. The interdisciplinary research training will help to generate new insights that can control biofilms in engineered and natural systems. The integrative scientific training program uses innovative teaching elements that will equip participants with professional, communication, teamwork, research, and problem-solving skills that are broadly applicable across a variety of industrial and academic research careers. The project anticipates training 71 Ph.D. students, including 21 NRT-funded trainees, with program activities also serving Ph.D. and M.S. students across a range of STEM departments.

The NRT trainees will use life in extreme environments to push the boundaries of interdisciplinary research, integrating meta-omics-based approaches with high resolution imaging to understand intricate and cross-cutting interactions occurring in multi-species and multi-domain biofilms. Students will investigate extreme biological systems that span the range of conditions where life survives, from the icy Antarctic cryosphere, to Yellowstone National Park terrestrial hot springs, to the hydrothermal vents of Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California. Major research themes include: (1) using metagenomics to examine genotypic variations and commonalities related to metabolic potential and diversity in extreme biofilm communities; (2) investigating patterns of biofilm composition and architecture using multi-scale microscopic imaging instrumentation; and (3) identifying patterns of extreme biofilm development, expression of novel pathways, and signaling molecules using proteomics and metabolomics. The traineeship’s project-based and collaborative science curriculum will help participants acquire the fundamental knowledge and skills necessary to converge across disciplinary boundaries to investigate the research themes, identifying properties and patterns of activity that explain biofilm cohesion and organization in extreme systems. Key elements of this NRT program are scalable and sustainable, including (1) a program that allows students personalize their technical training, curriculum, and mentor team; (2) seminars, courses, and activities that help trainees develop transferrable professional and technical skills that feature strongly across a range of research-related careers, and (3) recruitment, mentoring, and retention strategies that broaden STEM participation, foster mentoring and professional relationships, and improve students’ research productivity. The program provides a holistic educational experience for the trainees, where innovative training elements thoughtfully prepare participants to thrive in a variety of research careers.

In order to prepare students to transfer their classroom experiences to professional practice, engineering education needs to improve students’ ability to work in multidisciplinary teams, deal with diverse opinions, ideas, and backgrounds, and broaden their education to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global context. This project adopts a highly developed theoretical framework called “communities of practice” (CoP) and applies, researches, and further extends CoP theory in graduate classes across Civil Engineering, Computer Science, and Electrical Engineering. This approach has a strong emphasis on collaboration, teamwork, knowledge as doing, and communication across disciplinary and cultural backgrounds. 

By applying this approach in three engineering courses from three different engineering departments at North Carolina State University, this project will yield insights around student interactions and learning within different team settings: 1) integration into a professional engineering environment, studying how students interact with professionals and how the academic and professional communities learn from their encounters; 2) engagement in interdisciplinary projects in teams that bring together two disciplinary communities; and 3) engagement in interdisciplinary projects with teams that work on subsystems which need to be integrated into one working whole. This project will focus on how diversity plays out in CoPs, examine what factors lead to productive participation by all, what challenges inhibit participation and investigate approaches to structuring academic CoPs to support equitable learning and contributions by all. Through this approach which involves various settings and granularities in three different courses, this project will develop a broader view of how engineering students learn in different team settings. The proposed approach can help to bridge the gap between theory and practice, facilitating the development of a workforce that can work within and across teams, projects, and domains. To help apply the proposed approaches to other disciplines, we will develop and disseminate a set of guidelines in our future publications and presentations.

However, graduate training programs in STEM are not preparing students for changes in the nature and availability of work, shifts in workforce demographics, rising competition, macro ethics, and unremitting and striking innovations in technologies and research methods.  The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) recommends that STEM graduate education respond to workforce needs, connect theory to practice, utilize project-based learning, guide the exploration of diverse career paths, and develop core competencies as well as transferable professional skills. The National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Utah will respond to these recommendations by examining the impact and feasibility of a bold, new, transformative, team-based approach to graduate research development and entrepreneurship in engineering that optimizes the quality and consistency of mentoring interactions and relationships among members of the research team, and fosters graduate students’ professional competencies and workforce readiness.  This project not only helps graduate students develop the skills and knowledge to be successful in their discipline, but also enhances the quality and effectiveness of peer and faculty mentoring relationships to create a more inclusive, supportive, and productive research environment.  Results will inform the education community on best practices for training the next generation of STEM scientists.  

The Lean Canvas for Invention (LCI) is a web-based course that was recently developed and initially previously piloted. It will help research teams think through a research problem and plan and implement both team and individual research projects.  This project will expand the basic LCI by including formalized mentoring and career development.  The first research objective is to apply the expanded LCI with seven research teams and examine differences in student outcomes (e.g., quality of research proposals, critical thinking skills, research self-efficacy, etc.) between those who participated in the LCI and a representative sample of non-LCI peers.  The second research objective is to provide mentoring training and resources through interactions among students, faculty, and relevant industry stakeholders on a regular and structured basis.  Quantitative surveys and qualitative focus groups with LCI participants will evaluate the perceived quality, characteristics of, and satisfaction with their mentoring relationships and how mentoring influenced graduate students’ persistence attitudes.  Pre- and post-intervention surveys with LCI and non-LCI peers will examine students’ and faculty’s sense of belonging within the research team, the academic department, and the larger field of engineering.  The third research objective is to foster the development of professional competencies and workforce readiness by helping students create an individualized career development plan including career aspirations, goals, and action steps that will be reviewed at specific time points.  Career exploration resources, as well as structured networking opportunities with professionals in the engineering-related industry, will be provided.

The educational modules support experiential learning on a testbed that emulates the stages of product life-cycle management (PLM) undertaken in industry and support the development of skills for transferring of discipline-specific information to stakeholders across the PLM stages ranging from ideation to product verification, validation, and usage. A tool kit will provide the templates and rubrics for participatory educational design and collection of common datasets to assess the projected learning outcomes from implementations by a broader graduate education community.

Challenging issues related to environmental change, such as biodiversity loss and climate change, require a workforce of highly trained biologists who can collaborate across disciplines and produce solution-oriented scientific approaches. While our program is tailored to the disciplines of ecology and evolution, the basic elements of the program could be adapted to many STEM disciplines and broaden the impact of this approach.

The PIs of this project will work to enhance graduate student recruitment efforts through connection with multiple conferences and networks. The design of the graduate education model draws on theories of human motivation and personality (self-determination theory and sources of self-efficacy) to target psychological needs that, when satisfied, foster well-being and success in graduate school: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. By providing an early immersive field experience for a cohort of students the summer before they begin graduate school, our program will work to remove the barriers that fieldwork poses to students interested in ecology while providing critical early-training and cohort building to increase retention and students’ success. The project will take advantage of the well-established Niwot Ridge Long-Term Ecological Research (NWT LTER) program and the Mountain Research Station at CU Boulder. Evaluation of the program will focus on understanding how programmatic components support students in developing competence in the field and analytical methods, autonomy and independence as researchers, and a sense of belonging within the field.

However, there is growing concern that STEM graduate education may be falling short on preparing the nation’s workforce to face these global challenges. Equipping students with transformative skills in STEM is necessary for their future success, and for the sustainable development of society. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Pennsylvania State University will engage underrepresented graduate students in real-world international experiences. Students will develop creative solutions to complex sustainable development challenges as an integral part of team working in close collaboration with local communities. Each year, a cohort of 12 graduate students will advance technical, ecological, and social strategies for sustainable development in 1- to 6-month research internships at different sites around the world. To empower them to effectively and compassionately advocate for change where it is needed most, participants will also receive modular professional development training in science communication, multiculturalism, global leadership, and environmental justice. As a result, students will be better prepared to pursue diverse professional careers in sustainable development, increasing the capacity of the future workforce to solve important environmental challenges. 

The overarching goal of this IGE project is to improve the scientific basis of environmental decision-making, and increase the likelihood of successful implementation of sustainability strategies now and into the future. To meet this goal, this program aims to advance project-based learning through hypothesis-driven contextual systems research in sustainable development. Collaborative, stakeholder-driven research topics intersect at the water-energy-food nexus and include: water treatment and reuse; renewable energy production; nutrient management; sustainable agricultural systems; reducing air pollution and carbon emissions; remote sensing for environmental impact assessment; and climate change mitigation. Sustainable development provides a unifying and motivational theme under which faculty and students can work together across traditional academic boundaries, providing inherent opportunities for teamwork and transdisciplinary collaboration. This initiative is strategically designed to train and empower students that are members of underrepresented groups to develop and mobilize sustainable development solutions together with stakeholders and leading experts. Further, this project will build the foundational principles of transformative graduate education in sustainability that can be replicated at community-engaged institutions everywhere.

A centuries-old model of doctoral mentoring assumed that students learn by working alongside their faculty advisors at the lab bench. However, research as evolved into a team activity with advisors and students serving different roles and rarely working together at the same task. In this environment, students typically learn most research skills from advanced graduate students and postdoctoral researchers rather than their faculty advisors. Cascading mentorship describes such a model of mentoring from a rich network of faculty and peers. Doctoral students who receive cascading mentorship are much more likely to develop strong research skills than those who do not regardless of the quality of mentoring received from their primary faculty advisors. However, not all students are trained in large, well-functioning labs with ready-made cascading mentorship networks. In addition, factors such as shared or dissimilar cultural identity with the majority of faculty and differences in first-generation students’ access to faculty mentors, friends, or family members with doctoral degree experience may result in differences in the quality of mentoring. Thus, when doctoral programs fail to provide rich networks of cascading mentorship, it is the students from minority communities who are likely to suffer most.

In this project, approximately 65 advanced graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in cognitive science will be trained to lead cascading mentorship groups of five to ten doctoral students each. The groups will use proven pedagogical methods to help members plan their research, organize their time, and learn to produce the forms of writing on which academic success depends such as: literature reviews, funding proposals, research reports, etc. This project will address research questions related to four scale-up challenges: 1) group leader effects, i.e., whether the approach works when these mentorship groups are led by advanced graduate students rather than by a faculty member; 2) implementation cost, i.e., whether these groups can be supported in a way that is affordable for most doctoral programs; 3) long-term effects of cascading mentorship over a period of years in a variety of domains including: writing quantity and quality; progress through the graduate program; mental health and well-being; and 4) broad suitability, i.e., whether the model is equally effective for all students or whether only a subset of students benefit. Results from this project will help departments decide whether to adopt a cascading mentorship model program-wide or offer this model as an option for a subset of students.

Encouraging the participation of these students in STEM graduate programs will significantly benefit the creativity of our professional workforce, which in turn will help to identify groundbreaking solutions to the large-scale and complex scientific and technological challenges facing the nation. In addition to supporting national prosperity and competitiveness, increasing the participation of neurodiverse individuals in graduate programs will significantly benefit the well-being of these marginalized individuals who are currently highly underrepresented in STEM education. This National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Connecticut will embrace a strength-based approach towards neurodiversity. By identifying the nature of the challenges that neurodiverse students face in the prevailing one-size-fits-all model of STEM graduate education, this project aims to pilot and test innovative approaches to improve the sense of belonging, productivity, and overall experience of neurodiverse graduate students. In doing so, this project will generate knowledge that informs the development of more inclusive educational practices that capitalize on the unique talents of neurodiverse individuals. These practices will support the academic success of neurodiverse students and empower these individuals to contribute to future scientific and technological advancements. Changing the paradigm of disability, dysfunction, and disorder to one of diversity not only enhances the participation of nontraditional learners in STEM education but also benefits society and the nation at large.

By adopting a strength-based approach toward neurodiversity, this project will be at the forefront of efforts to promote a culture of inclusivity in STEM graduate education. Toward this end, the project employs a theory of change model with four integrated activities to pilot and test easy-to-implement interventions with high potential to support the success of students with ADHD and dyslexia in STEM graduate programs. Activities will encourage participation of these populations of students by adopting a strength-based approach toward neurodiversity. This project aims to evaluate three core hypotheses: 1) increasing neurodiverse students’ awareness of their unique strengths and challenges enhances their self-efficacy and self-advocacy, 2) providing opportunities for peer-to-peer interaction enhances the sense of belonging and experience of neurodiverse students in STEM graduate programs, and 3) providing writing interventions focused on students’ metacognitive skills enhances their writing productivity. The data from the integrated research plan and formal evaluation will generate critical knowledge for the scale-up of the proposed activities and inform future enhancements of STEM graduate education. This project will generate data on the efficacy of evidence-based approaches and interventions that are inspired by the framework of positive psychology to inform the development of an inclusive graduate education environment. This knowledge will be shared with engineering educators through a workshop at the ASEE annual meeting and formal publications. Supported by a strong institutional commitment, the multidisciplinary team of principal investigators and the diverse project advisory board composed of university administrators, researchers, industry leaders, philanthropists, and graduate students will guide the recruitment, data collection, data analysis, dissemination, and outreach activities of the project.

NRT-HDR Data Driven Decision Making to Address Complex Resource Problems

“No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story,” explained Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman. Telling stories, while remaining true to the data, is a defining challenge of this century. Narratives are persuasive but not objective; numbers are often objective but not persuasive. For science to provide the broadest beneficial impact to society, its findings need to be communicated with both scientific integrity and authentic empathy. Although a growing number of interdisciplinary careers demand this dual fluency, current graduate curricula do not adequately prepare students to master these skills. At many institutions, training remains siloed, and curricular partitions separate those with skills in data science theory, deep domain-specific knowledge, and policy analysis. These partitions do not map well to the real world, where the most pressing social and environmental challenges demand interdisciplinary innovation and collaboration. Effective interdisciplinary collaboration requires a level of exposure, experience, and practice in real-world problem-solving that combines numbers and narratives. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Tufts University will address this need by educating Data Professionals who will synthesize numbers and narratives to design and implement data-driven solutions that are technically efficient and contextually appropriate. The project anticipates training over 140 masters and doctoral trainees: 20 NRT Fellows with stipends, 50 NRT Problem-Focused Immersion Fellows, 60 NRT Travel Awardees, and 12 NRT Module Developers. 

This NRT will train two types of data professionals. Policy-Savvy Data Experts—primarily from STEM disciplines—will advance the frontiers of data science and will be able to (a) identify, analyze, and solve a problem with the appropriate data-driven theory, tools, and techniques; and (b) adapt and acquire skill sets to harness emerging data-focused technologies, techniques, and tools. At the same time, they will have training in policy-relevant skills and be able to collaborate with the less technically trained decision-makers in their workplace. Data-Proficient Decision Makers—primarily from non-STEM disciplines—will use data in policy development and decision making. They will be able to (a) collaborate effectively on teams that include users and producers of data, including scientists, engineers, practitioners, and decision-makers with different backgrounds and perspectives; and (b) provide data-informed advice in an actionable way as well as broadly communicate those results for effective action. Trainees will have hands-on experience with a growing portfolio of data science tools and methods that facilitate the rapid translation of data into actionable information. Training will be grounded in finding, defining and resolving problems from both data-rich (i.e., big data) and data-scarce contexts common to many real-world resource problems – including those at the intersection of Food, Energy, Water, and Ecosystems. This NRT model will provide an interdisciplinary theory-practice synthesis by building on two potentially transformative components: (1) Modular Course Elements (MCEs); and (2) Problem-Focused Immersion (PFI). A unique aspect of this NRT is the use of a common database across the MCEs, akin to the adoption of a common book in Writing Across the Curriculum programs. The proposed problem-focused and theory-practice synthesis strategy will foster deeper actionable collaboration among data science experts, domain experts, practitioners, and decision-makers. With this project’s commitment and plan to educate Data Professionals from STEM and non-STEM disciplines, it will actively pursue broadening participation in data science from under-represented groups. Content-rich, modular and adaptable nature of program elements will make them transferrable across disciplines and institutions and sustainable beyond the NRT grant period.

The health, environmental, and economic burden of hazardous byproducts of this process falls disproportionately on the most vulnerable communities. To drive change towards a sustainable future and improved outcomes for all, there is a need to train future leaders in the circular economy that maximizes use of renewable materials, increases the efficiency of manufacturing processes, upcycles wastes into valuable byproducts, and minimizes the harm of irreducible waste streams. Despite much effort, educational models training students to become experts in increasingly isolated fields and without regard for communication with stakeholders have not yielded the desired results. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to Worcester Polytechnic Institute will address this demand by establishing the CEDAR Program (Circular Economy and Data Analytics Engineering Research for Sustainability) to educate an outward facing community of scholars versed in data-driven sustainable engineering solutions to the challenges preventing transition to a circular economy. The CEDAR traineeship anticipates providing a comprehensive training opportunity for one hundred and twenty (120) graduate students, including thirty (30) funded PhD-level trainees, in disciplines ranging from chemical sciences (chemistry, biology, physics, engineering) to data sciences (computing, business analytics, statistics, mathematics) with a convergent focus on advancement of circular economies. 

The CEDAR traineeship interweaves technical and social considerations and focuses on the well-being of our society. This integrated traineeship in data and chemical sciences will develop leaders ready to transform industrial chemical processes towards a green and circular economy by addressing fundamental problems in three critical areas: (1) development of atom and energy efficient processes, (2) understanding and deploying upcycling, and (3) minimizing harm from the irreducible waste streams that cannot be avoided. Communication and collaboration across traditional disciplinary boundaries are fostered via professional workshops and convergent research seminars team-taught by instructors from distinct disciplines. To drive change, trainees learn leadership skills by participating in multi-way exchanges of ideas and advocacy with audiences ranging from the general public to academia, government, and industry. Connections with industry made by participating in CEDAR community retreats, CEDAR External Advisory Board meetings and in the internship program will strengthen trainee professional and career development, and infuse talent into the sustainable economy. The CEDAR program will tackle the underrepresentation of women and minorities in STEM disciplines by employing innovative minority-centric recruiting strategies using peer ambassadors to cultivate relationships with faculty and potential students at the program’s partner universities, creating pipelines to CEDAR. Focus on social, ethical and business implications will further help recruit a diverse cohort of students and train well-rounded leaders that are advocates for the sustainable circular economy.

To make this vision a reality, important considerations include safety, adaptability to human desires, and nuanced societal impacts, such as dignity, consent, privacy, and fairness.  Traditional social sciences often study the effects of technology on individuals and society only after it is deployed.  Given the potential impact of robotics as well as the potential for unintended negative social consequences, technology should adapt to humans rather than the other way around. Current robotics training does not equip researchers with the interdisciplinary tools necessary to address this challenge.   This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Rutgers University will train a new type of professional, the socially cognizant roboticist, with the skills—in technology, social science, and public policy—needed to bridge this gap.  This training program aims to instill an awareness of human involvement into every phase of the design of new technology, so that these technologies can provide positive human value wherever they are introduced. The training program anticipates training over 35 graduate students (MS and PhD), including 17 NRT-funded trainees, by integrating technology domains (robotics, machine learning and computer vision) with social and behavioral sciences (psychology, cognitive science, and urban policy planning).

The program will integrate the training of technologists, who are able to develop robots that can coordinate with people, and social scientists, who can translate studies regarding the social effects of robotics into actionable lessons. Robotics is defined broadly here to include intelligent systems encompassing smart buildings and embedded infrastructure. Program participants will be trained in 1) technology: building and controlling robots, collecting, and learning from large datasets; 2) cognitive science: designing socially cognizant systems; 3) policy: assessing unintended consequences and planning for positive societal impact. The program lays the groundwork for this training via a new curriculum for a robotics specialization that combines existing technology and social science courses, as well as new interdisciplinary courses. The program will emphasize experiential learning, through the Rutgers Robotics Live Lab and interdisciplinary research projects from the partnering graduate programs, as well as internship opportunities through an Industry Consortium. Trainees will engage in fundamental research to understand and model the social dimensions of robot deployments and advance the long-term goal of dignified living and working in a technologically enhanced society. An important program objective is the recruitment and retention of diverse trainees through a multi-faceted strategy, including a student-led robotics club that focuses on a novice-to-expert strategy, an annual robotics workshop, and a Faculty Talk-it-up Robotics Series for underrepresented populations.

The program enables trainees to generate new knowledge about objects from anthropological, biological, and geological museum collections, that will enable multidisciplinary research about how natural, physical, and human systems change through time and space. A central goal will be to understand past changes in the arid Southwestern United States through time, and how life, including diverse human communities, might respond to future changes in climate and water availability. Through research and educational activities, trainees will enhance the informational value of museum objects and collections by harnessing data science and cutting-edge techniques such as high-resolution image analysis, DNA sequencing and informatics, and elemental chemistry. This information will be intersected with data on biodiversity and social or physical systems, with the aim to describe and model biological and cultural responses to environmental and geological change in an environmentally and culturally diverse region. Working together, faculty and student research teams will address coupled human-natural impacts of climate change, water dynamics in drylands, effects of landscape transformation on ecosystem processes, and analytical linkages of object-based information with large-scale data infrastructure. This award enables education, training, and mentoring activities to recruit and train a diverse set of professionals with unique intersectional expertise, and directly supports 40 trainees at the MS and PhD levels, and extends program elements and benefits to 35 additional graduate (75 total) and 40 undergraduate students.

This museum-based NRT program addresses significant academic, structural, and cultural barriers that hinder cross-disciplinary initiatives in basic and applied object-based research. Ethical justification for scientific collecting and long-term support of the vast infrastructural investment that the US has made in building collections of physical materials revolves around their utility for answering scientific questions that are critical for societal well-being. Research and education activities include amplifying the information value of museum objects by linking those that share times and places into an Extended Object Network (EON). The EON framework spans across collections, incorporates biodiversity, social, and physical system databases to facilitate the description, testing, and modeling of biological and cultural responses to environmental change. The program prepares students for careers that require: (1) understanding or designing environment- or socio/economic-related research that leverages scientific collections; (2) innovative and effective use of museum resources in educational settings; (3) engaging the broader environmental research and policy community; and, (4) effectively working in collaborative teams, including development of mentoring skills. Program elements include co-mentorship in a cross-museum setting, modular courses that converge epistemological systems across disciplines, activities that provide both generalized and specialized insights into computation and data integration, and training in ethical issues affecting museums collecting and collections-based research. The geographic focus of research and training themes is the American Southwest, a region with rich cultural and natural histories and a well-known history of environmental change. Such place-based research allows trainees to dig into complex problems and is particularly effective at reaching underrepresented students because it is relevant to their own lives, experiences, and communities. Through interactions with external non-academic partners and thematically similar NRTs, this program creates pathways to several careers for trainees who have vital roles to play in science, policy, and resource management.

Fundamentally secure communication, the design and synthesis of new materials, and sensing with single atoms are all technologies that will be accelerated with the understanding and control of quantum mechanical phenomena. In these early days of quantum technology development, hardware knowledge is essential for software engineers to optimize architectures, efficiently implement algorithms, and correct errors. The breakthroughs needed in the materials for scalable quantum devices requires materials and device scientists and computer architecture engineers to be trained in quantum information. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to the University of Washington (UW) will address these needs by training master’s and doctoral students in an interdisciplinary program in quantum information science and technology (QIST). The traineeship anticipates providing training to one hundred and ninety (190) students including twenty-two (22) funded trainees, by combining disciplines in quantum information (chemistry, physics, applied mathematics, materials science & engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and computer science), interactions with national laboratories and industry partners,  project-based learning on commercially available cloud quantum computers, and hands-on research in QIST. There is a growing national need for US quantum scientists to meet the current workforce demands from US national laboratories and industries (including startups and established companies). This need will be met by (1) increasing UW graduate students’ QIST knowledge and skills, (2) increasing the participation of women in QIST by effectively implementing targeted recruitment and retention strategies and introduction of QIST concepts into UW’s undergraduate curricula, and (3) developing publicly available educational materials from our most innovative courses. 

At the core of the traineeship program is the “learn, practice, apply” approach with a heavy emphasis on project-based learning. The 15-month training program begins with one of three domain-specific courses that provides not only a foundation in QIST concepts but are also co-designed to provide a common technical vocabulary across disciplines. The foundational course is followed by an interdisciplinary project-based course that will utilize classical computer simulations of quantum devices as well as experiments on real quantum devices, provided by industry partners.  These resources will help teach essential concepts in quantum information implementations while solidifying student’s theoretical understanding of QIST. An advanced-topics course and interdisciplinary team capstone project designed to apply the newly acquired skills to real-world applications complete the curriculum. The project-based learning curriculum also provides the opportunity to practice and improve leadership, management, team and communication skills through the program’s professional development workshops. Successful completion of the program results in a transcriptable option in QIST for both MS and PhD students.

This NRT closely aligns with NSF’s Navigating the New Arctic program and with UAF’s strategic goals of solidifying global leadership in Alaska Native and Indigenous programs and growing a culture of respect, diversity, inclusion, and care. As the gravity of environmental and social challenges in the Arctic continues to intensify, the need for bold and transformative action that crosses cultural, racial, and disciplinary boundaries grows. To respond to this need, the Tamamta traineeship program will support comprehensive graduate training that advances science that meaningfully and ethically bridges Western and Indigenous knowledge systems for 15 to 20 Indigenous and non-Indigenous M.S. and Ph.D. NRT trainees. The Tamamta program will reach over 100 students over the course of the project and will engage federal, state, and tribal partner organizations toward larger system change within fisheries and marine science and management in Alaska and beyond.

Over the past five years, the Tamamta project team of Indigenous scholars, social scientists, and natural scientists has worked across cultural and disciplinary boundaries to build strong, collaborative relationships. This investment and the mutual respect and trust that have grown as a result are necessary to advance the goals of this work in effective and culturally appropriate ways. The research team uses evidence-based and Indigenous approaches to transforming graduate educational programs including an elevation of Indigenous ways of knowing and being, Indigenous rights and values, Indigenous knowledge, language, stories, and practices. This traineeship program supports interactive and innovative activities to help transform the fisheries and marine sciences programs and catalyze change in institutions and partner organizations. These activities will include: new team-taught interdisciplinary courses; an Elder-in-Residence program; a visiting Indigenous scholars program; a fish camp and other cultural immersion experiences; professional development and cultural competency skill-building with faculty and agency partners; retreats; internships; coastal research experiences; hosted dialogues; and art installations. By centering Indigenous cosmologies, values, practices, and knowledge in all aspects of the program, Tamamta aims to elevate an understanding of the profound cultural and spiritual connections that Indigenous peoples across Alaska have with the land, waters, and animals. By creating meaningful educational opportunities for Indigenous peoples and their values, practices, and knowledge to engage in science and management systems, this effort will contribute to larger system changes that are needed to ensure more sustainable fisheries and ecosystems for current and future generations.

This traineeship program will create a novel, cross-cutting framework for STEM education that combines collaborative and problem-based learning and research, while applying techniques aimed at recruiting and retaining a more diverse student cohort. Trainees will develop new skills in an immersive, team-based education model that also applies new knowledge to real-life applications. Enhanced skills in risk assessment, management, and communication will create a highly skilled workforce that can address the 21st Century threats to human life support systems. The traineeship anticipates preparing 64 Ph.D. students, including 32 funded trainees from the life sciences, engineering, geography, geosciences, natural resources, statistics, economics, and computer science. Ultimately the grant will promote the training of students for jobs as risk analysts in a range of careers, not just in academia, but also in industry, non-profit organizations, and government. 

In a rapidly urbanizing world, society needs landscapes that are resilient to risks to food, energy, and water, and other ecosystem services (FEWES). The challenge for society is to design landscapes that provide multiple human benefits, maintain ecosystem function, and prove resilient to future risks. This project will address unresolved debates such as whether to develop land intensely, leaving more land untouched (land-sparing) or to develop land moderately, but over a wider area (land-sharing). To resolve such debates and create resilient urban-to-wild landscapes, students will learn how to apply landscape risk assessment to estimate threats, benefits, and uncertainty by exploring landscape linkages and developing scenarios that include socioeconomic impacts for tradeoffs among FEWES. This traineeship will also develop a novel, cross-cutting framework for teaching STEM education by synergistically combining collaborative, problem-based, and service-based learning to assess risks to FEWES. These practices will be combined to develop a unique approach to graduate education called Team-TERRA, or Team-based, Transdisciplinary, Estimation of Risks, and Real-world Analysis. Students will originate from different backgrounds and disciplines and will learn to transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. Trainees will earn a certificate in Environmental Risk Assessment by learning how to work with stakeholders, develop quantitative analytical skills in predicting risk and uncertainty, explore options for managing such risks, and communicate risk and uncertainty to clients, stakeholders, and the public. Overall, trainees will learn transferable skills by working with real-world problems, while providing an important service to governments, NGOs, and businesses.

A fundamental transformation of our energy system from dependence on fossil fuels to a sustainable and resilient system supplied by renewable sources such as wind and solar is necessary if we are to avoid harmful climate change impacts. To successfully achieve this transition requires innovative technology and policy solutions in the electricity sector. These solutions must reimagine the electricity sector in a way that is simultaneously equitable in the benefits and impacts to society as well as resilient to uncertainty in future climate trends and energy demands. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Massachusetts Amherst will train graduate master’s and doctoral students to solve the integrated technological, economic, and societal challenges in the transition to a low carbon future. The project anticipates training 125 MS and PhD students, including 29 funded trainees, from Civil, Industrial, Electrical & Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, Economics, Environmental Conservation, Geosciences, and Political Science. The students will conduct research at the intersection of electricity technology, energy economics and policy, climate science, and social equity. They will produce resilient and equity-driven innovations, while developing effective leadership and communication skills ideally suited to engaging stakeholders. Through strategic partnerships with stakeholders at the front lines of the energy transition, the program will develop a collaborative community, working together to find optimal energy solutions with local to global-scale benefits.

The key goal of the program is to integrate concepts of equity and resiliency into research and training on the energy transition. The program will foster an integrated understanding of how technology and policies impact communities and how climate uncertainty necessitates resilient energy system solutions. This in turn will impact research goals. We will use an electricity market simulator to bring students from diverse educational and socio-economic backgrounds together. Trainees will identify how technology and policy combine to impact equity; and through role-play they will develop understanding and empathy for a wide range of perspectives. The students will receive training on public engagement and will produce events and communication platforms that will enhance communication between researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and community leaders. Research will focus on robust solutions to balancing the supply and demand of electricity in a way that is equitable and resilient to climate change. The project will develop ensembles of probabilistic estimates of energy demand and supply across multiple time scales, develop metrics to evaluate equity impacts, and use climate and power flow models to inform robust decision-making. The project will produce impactful energy research outcomes where adequate knowledge is currently lacking, while providing the trainees with an expanded interdisciplinary tool kit applicable to regions across the US and beyond, and a long- term competitive advantage to effect change.

Unfortunately, there are numerous obstacles in contemporary scientific research that preclude universal reproducibility. These range from key omissions or vague instructions in the experimental description to journals that require subscriptions and thus restrict access to the entire scientific product.  Open Science is an approach to conducting reproducible research, but its practices are difficult and time-consuming to adopt. The National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to University of Georgia will pilot an educational program that teams up students and faculty conducting research, with the ultimate goal of lowering barriers to conducting Open Science and catalyzing an institutional shift toward an open and transparent approach to science. The project will incentivize Open Science practices in research and education and will provide additional training opportunities to students and faculty alike to obtain skills in Open Science that are otherwise not offered in a contemporary research setting. This project will establish new curricula, creating new opportunities for future students and faculty as well as endowing them with skills that are highly sought in a variety of fields. 

Recent surveys reveal a pervasive belief that there is a broad reproducibility crisis in science. Examples abound across disciplines: seminal studies have been, upon later scrutiny and attempts to replicate, revealed as irreproducible. Open Science offers a principled, albeit abstract, approach to scientific research that emphasizes openness and reproducibility. Most scientists agree reproducibility must be addressed. Yet, the adoption of open practices has remained anemic, as the culture surrounding research has not been sufficiently incentivized to change, nor has the practice of Open Science been defined as a concrete process. This 3-year project aims to study how to catalyze a cultural shift in the research and educational practices at the University of Georgia. Critically, the approach is process-oriented and bidirectional: students will be recruited at varying stages of their graduate careers as the experimental cohort, and a peer support structure will be established among them. Faculty will also be recruited: supervisors of participating graduate students and experts in Open Science and institutional change. These students and faculty, representing a variety of STEM disciplines, will participate in a series of workshops to obtain a formal understanding of Open Science. Participating faculty will sustain this curriculum through their own Open Science training with external experts, course modifications, and an interdisciplinary graduate certificate program formalizing the coursework and standards for training in Open Science principles and practices. This will establish a network of influencers to effect broad institutional change, further facilitating a cultural shift toward adoption of Open Science.

This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Colorado Boulder will test the effectiveness of a new program to educate and train interdisciplinary data scientists who can move between theory and practice to solve problems for real-world impact. This program combines innovative classroom instruction and learning activities in the theory of interdisciplinary collaboration with practical data science experience working on real projects in the Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis (LISA). Specifically, graduate students will learn how to adopt effective attitudes of collaboration, how to structure effective meetings with domain experts, what to focus on to make deep contributions to the domain, effective communication skills, and how to cultivate strong relationships with their collaborators. At the same time, students will learn how to put this knowledge into practice by collaborating with researchers, businesses, and policy makers to apply data science to solve a wide variety of domain-specific problems for decision-making. Ultimately, this program may lead to a transformation in who can be trained to become data scientists, where they can be trained, and what can be achieved when we transform data into societal benefits.

In this model, the capstone requirement for the STEM PhD is satisfied through the publication of original research in academic journals, where the work must be evaluated favorably by experts through peer-review. In recent years, there has been an increasing participation of STEM PhDs in technology entrepreneurship, through the development of patentable technologies, and the formation of startup companies. The STEM PhD program, as it exists, does not adequately provide this growing proportion of the STEM workforce who are active in entrepreneurship with the necessary professional skills and preparation. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) will introduce a novel approach in which STEM PhD students will develop patentable technologies as the capstone requirement. These innovations will be implemented in a new program called Pathways to Entrepreneurship (PAtENT), which will provide an alternate pathway to earning a doctoral degree that has the potential to spur graduation rates, generate employment in the local communities in which it is deployed, and maintain the nation’s edge in technological innovation. 

The central goal of the project will be to develop an alternate roadmap for STEM PhD students that is scalable and reflects the rapidly evolving workforce needs. This goal will be achieved without sacrificing the technical rigor of the traditional PhD program, by subjecting the patent applications to external peer review. An independent evaluator will collect extensive data on the efficacy of the program, and address specific objectives such as the alignment of the roadmap with the core scientific and professional elements required for a PhD, assess the scalability potential of the pilot study, develop recommendations for STEM programs at other doctoral institutions across the country, and measure the participation rates and employment outcomes of under-represented minorities targeted by the program. The evaluation will consist of a mixed-methods design that will include surveys, polls and interviews developed for current students and faculty, and reflective questions for the project leadership.

The reasons likely range from mistakes in daily research practice to misconduct and fraud. Better ethics education is one mechanism that can lead to better conduct in science. Mandatory courses such as “Responsible Conduct of Research” (RCR) serve to teach topics in the field of science ethics and integrity at most institutions. Much has been published on improving the pedagogy of research ethics education, however, many RCR courses still focus on describing flawless ethical practice on the one hand and denouncing cases of outright misconduct or fraud on the other. The large grey zone in between, the so-called questionable research practices (QRPs) are rarely taught in a formal manner. Yet they play an important role for ethical decision making in day-to-day scientific practice. This National Science Foundation Innovation in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the Johns Hopkins University will fill that critical gap in graduate research ethics education. 

Through this award, the RCR course that is currently offered at Johns Hopkins will be supplemented with an established, online learning module on principles and applications in scientific error analysis with a focus on QRPs, which has been tested in a low-enrollment setting.  The Rigorous, Responsible and Reproducible Practice in Science and Engineering (R3ISE) module utilizes a novel error analysis and quality-improvement approach. The goal of this research comprises assessing the learning outcomes of the R3ISE module in a large and diverse student population across the life, natural, and social sciences, as well as engineering and technology. The study will appraise students’ critical thinking, scientific reasoning and collaborative communication skills around analyzing and avoiding scientific errors in general and QRPs. The R3ISE module is a collaborative, staged case study approach enhanced by illustrative practitioner interviews, that advances students in interdisciplinary groups from the learning level of recognizing QRPs in retracted articles to the level of evaluatively reviewing preprints. Sustained reasoning and communication skills are practiced and reinforced in annual workshops including poster competitions and preprint journal clubs. Using historic controls for comparison, researchers will test the hypothesis that the implementation of the R3ISE online companion module on scientific error analysis and reduction methods will influence students’ conceptual understanding, application, and evaluation skills of QRPs. A mixed-methods design will yield quantitative and qualitative data from concept inventories, checklists on case study analyses, descriptive rubrics on reviewing performance and structured observation guides on poster and preprint presentations.

The program will address two fundamental education research questions: How can project management skill training be integrated with thesis research in graduate education? What is the role (or value) of learning communities in enhancing the training and retention of professional skills and effectiveness of thesis research? Studies suggest that current graduate education focuses too narrowly on thesis research, and graduate students are not well prepared with skills for future work in industry or the academy. However, limited resources and lack of faculty support prevent students from committing to skill training. To address these challenges, this e program will develop innovative training approaches to help students learn and practice project management skills. 

Utilizing the framework of communities of practice, the project will have two major innovations. The first is engaging students with self-directed, learning activities to produce and evaluate new course content as they learn from the curated online modules. The second is practicing the professional skills integrated with the thesis research. This new learning model has the potential to fundamentally change the culture of graduate education, efficiently utilize the current resources, and obtain faculty buy-in. Associated research design will explore factors that may lead to the success of a learning community, help reconceptualize current graduate education and encourage broader adoption of these new approaches within and beyond STEM fields. The evaluation approach is informed by the pragmatic evaluation paradigm, and a variety of data will be collected in the study including program participation data, document analysis, student surveys, and faculty and industry partner interviews. The program will rigorously test over multiple cohort iterations and with control groups the benefits of this approach, including the synergy created between thesis research and professional skill training through the GAPS program. The goal is to disrupt the status quo of graduate education (courses followed by individual research) and build sustainable GAPS communities that can effectively improve professional skills for graduate students. Ultimately, the program will improve graduate student job readiness and placement upon graduation.

At each level of the educational and career pipeline (e.g. student, postdoctoral, faculty), underrepresentation becomes more severe. At the most advanced levels of the academic ranks, the postdoctoral and faculty levels, the number of positions in the US has increased substantially over the past two decades, providing a window of opportunity for diversification of the professoriate.  While the number of URM PhD recipients has grown, the URG share of faculty positions in these fields has increased only modestly, particularly at the nation’s research universities. If one important focus of diversity efforts at research universities is to place URG scholars into the professoriate, these scholars need to do more than complete their Ph.D. programs – they must stand out in terms of the “gold standard” by which prospective applicants for postdoctoral and faculty jobs are judged: their publication record. A candidate’s publication record is the most important criterion for potential employment in most four-year and almost all research universities, and is a measure of success in the academy, including for promotions to tenure.  This National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of California, Berkeley, will address disparities in outcomes, including publication records, for URM doctoral students, while improving the graduate education experience for all students. 

The Identity, Structure and Belonging (ISB) project will tackle the persistent problem of underrepresentation not at the level of individual faculty or student perceptions, actions, or interactions, but rather, at the level of the organizational structure of graduate programs. IGE-ISB will use a mixed methods research approach that begins with synthesis of existing data, followed by extensive qualitative data collection (participant-driven semi-structured interviews), rigorous analysis, development of a “blueprint” describing how features of graduate programs work to create equitable career outcomes; and a quantitative self-assessment tool (a Likert-type questionnaire) by which departments and universities can assess their graduate program design. IGE-ISB will address this key research question: What are the underlying graduate program structures reflected in everyday practices and routine day-to-day ways of doing things in doctoral programs that produce equitable outcomes for their students? How might departments alter their structures to establish processes, procedures, and climate that are effective at preparing all, equitably, for the full array of careers that lead from a PhD education, including academic careers? What are the specific methods by which departments establish clarity of expectations and a sense of belonging at critical stages of the doctoral programs to enhance equitable outcomes? IGE-ISB will develop a blueprint of graduate program features that lead to equitable career outcomes for students, one that is pragmatic and applicable across departments, and that can be applied at a national scale.

During this time, STEM graduate education has continued to rely largely on traditional learning models. These learning models historically have not emphasized professional skills development and career exploration, now recognized as key to long-term career success in STEM fields. Many institutions encourage students to address career and professional development needs through optional extra-curricular opportunities. The sporadic nature of these opportunities makes it difficult for students and faculty to learn about programs and to use them for effective learning. Moreover, when professional development and career exploration are not intentionally built into the arc of graduate training and assessed for effectiveness, graduate programs risk poor use of resources and an inconsistent training experience. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Michigan will develop an adaptive professional training (APT) system that will gather opportunities across the institution from different levels (e.g. department, college, university, external) into a single system. The data and knowledge gained from the system will help to guide skill development for graduate students.

This project will test the idea that providing a structured learning framework for professional development guided by formative mentor feedback and artificial intelligence-directed recommendations will enable more effective professional skill-building and student career success.  The proposed platform, the Adaptive Professional Training (APT) learning management system (LMS) will integrate the following key innovations: (1) a user-friendly online hub of learning opportunity listings across the institution and beyond linked with defined by core professional skill competencies, (2) adaptive and iterative learning recommendations tailored to individual needs and interests based on both mentor and trainee input, (3) portfolio building, and (4) program assessment capabilities to enable evidence-based educational policy and resource optimization. This APT LMS represents a new flexible learning paradigm by which diverse professional training opportunities can be intentionally integrated into STEM graduate education. We will test whether use of the APT LMS by a test student cohort, compared to a control student cohort, will promote more intentional time investment in professional development and more uniform improvement in defined competencies, like science communication and increased awareness of learning resources. We predict that this innovative educational approach will integrate student and mentor input, enabling planning, documentation, and engagement in a systematic manner, leading to more effective acquisition of the professional skills associated with student career success.

URM students enroll in and complete PhD degrees in STEM at a much lower rate than majority groups; they also often face what educational researchers refer to as “climates of intimidation” within higher education and STEM. This project’s goals are to support students’ empowerment, agency and authenticity for academic success and social integration into STEM.  This will be accomplished with a training program that translates the evidence-based findings of the learning disabilities communities to promote self-advocacy and positively impact the retention and academic success of URM PhD students. This IGE will address whether teaching self-advocacy increases the academic success, social integration and general well-being of URM PhD STEM students, and thereby lead to improvements in doctoral degree attainment.
 
A comprehensive review of evidence-based practices for teaching self-advocacy within the learning disability communities found that there are three critical factors that, when combined, result in increased academic success: empowerment, self-awareness, and social justice. Self-advocacy has been shown to increase students’ retention during critical transitions to post-secondary education or increase participation in learning STEM disciplines, while also increasing academic success. Thus, the research hypothesis is that teaching self-advocacy will result in improved academic success, improved social integration, and improved health and well-being for URM STEM graduate students at UIC, many of whom are first generation or low-income. The societal impact of this grant will be a successful graduate education program that is inclusive of URM students and that will inform on a broader scale how to increase participation of URM graduate students in STEM disciplines. It is anticipated that the translation of evidence-based educational practices from the learning disabilities communities will serve as a foundation for teaching self-advocacy to URM STEM graduate students, and further the translation of these practices to other student populations and fields at UIC and other institutions of higher learning that want to increase the academic success of their URM graduate students. This work will also add to the needed scholarship on the factors that impact resilience of URM STEM PhD graduate students and how self-advocacy affects their academic success and health/well-being.

They will also identify potential best practices for responding to the pandemic, thus providing a starting point for broader national conversations.  The Board on Science Education and the Board on Higher Education and Workforce at the National Academy of Sciences will convene the workshops, which will focus on sharing of challenges and responses among stakeholders.  These conversations will illuminate the areas of greatest challenge, including challenge areas that disproportionately affect certain populations of students, faculty, or types of institutions. 

As the nation addresses the immediate impacts of COVID-19, these workshops will provide an opportunity to deepen understanding of the resiliency of the postsecondary education system in the U.S. in terms of disaster preparedness, the ability to provide access and accommodation for all students and faculty, and the ripple effects of this public health event on the research enterprise. The workshops will provide an opportunity for institutions to share strategies and lessons learned in the early months of the pandemic. By providing a forum for institutions of all types to come together and learn from each other, the workshops will make it possible for institutions to modify their strategies in real-time and, thus, can have an immediate impact on campuses across the country. Furthermore, the workshops will examine how institutions’ responses might have differential effects on students and faculty depending on their backgrounds (race/ethnicity, gender, SES), age, disability status and other factors in their lives.  These insights can help institutions examine the impacts on their own campuses and adapt their responses to better serve all members of the educational and research communities they serve.

COVID-19 has rapidly upended graduate students’ learning, research, and teaching. Carefully crafted career paths that often require substantial investments by both students and their institutions have been placed at risk due to newly imposed challenges. These challenges include limited access to classrooms and labs, disruption to current and planned collaborations, increased stress and anxiety, and new responsibilities for children and other family members. This impact is particularly acute for graduate students with marginalized identities (e.g., students of color, low-income students) who are often already struggling with existing inequalities. To compound matters, these hardships confront a graduate student population that multiple studies suggest was already facing a mental health crisis. If graduate students do not feel supported during this critical period, the U.S. may suffer a dramatic decline in the effectiveness and inclusiveness of its graduate-level training, resulting in long-term negative impacts on the U.S. scientific knowledge base, society, and the broader U.S. economy. This National Science Foundation Rapid Response Research (RAPID) award to Montana State University, Iowa State University, and Texas A&M-Commerce will support research on: postsecondary institutional policies and practices that are designed to help graduate students feel supported during the COVID-19 pandemic and the influence of these efforts on graduate student educational and career decision-making. The study will contribute to a research base for graduate school administrators and faculty about how to immediately help graduate students during a crisis, as well as what strategies might be most effective for supporting graduate students in STEM fields and more broadly as they make degree and career-related decisions as society emerges from the crisis. 

The project is a multi-institution, two-phase explanatory mixed method study of graduate students’ experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, their perceptions of institutional support, and near-term impact of this support on educational and career decision-making. The research team will leverage existing institutional higher education networks to solicit the participation of 15 institutions and disseminate questionnaires to 30,000 graduate students in late spring/early summer 2020. The research is informed by scholarship on trauma and disaster response. The survey, which will include validated trauma scales that measure post-traumatic stress disorder-like symptoms, anxiety, and depression, will be designed by an interdisciplinary team that includes trauma and mental health experts. Team members will then conduct virtual focus groups using semi-structured qualitative interview protocols to explore students’ experiences and reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic in-depth, and how these experiences relate to their identities, persistence, and career aspirations. Researchers will integrate both quantitative and qualitative data to further interpret, explain, and provide new insights to understanding graduate student experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses will pay particular attention to student experiences related to race, class, gender, and other socio-demographic factors. Multiple efforts will be made at each stage to recruit and support participation of underrepresented minority STEM graduate students in the study. Results of the research will be disseminated through peer reviewed scholarship, a white paper, and workshops providing graduate college leadership and STEM faculty with research-based guidelines on how to support the broadest range of their graduate students during a time of crisis.

Alaskan coastal Indigenous communities face severe, urgent, and complex social and infrastructural challenges resulting from environmental changes. Coastlines are degrading and this impacts infrastructure that communities use on a daily basis, changing how people access and hunt for food and other natural resources and conduct their lives. The magnitude and significance of impacts are unclear as is how local communities will respond to resulting disruptions and disasters. A major problem facing researchers, stakeholders, and policymakers in addressing these issues is that existing research is piecemeal. The whole picture of coastal communities is not well understood, and ways to address problems they face are not as effective as they could be. A changing environment drives changes to the populations of Alaskan coastal Indigenous communities due to families and individuals relocating either seasonally or permanently, which complicates efforts to understand the relationship between environmental changes and society. These challenges demand a robust, integrated, and convergent research platform to identify the complexities of the issues and the ways communities can respond.  The POLARIS (Pursuing Opportunities for Long-term Arctic Resilience for Infrastructure and Society) project supplies just that kind of research platform for analyzing current and future needs in order to create resilient communities in the face of a changing environment.

The POLARIS project has identified three convergent research pillars to help communities adapt: environmental hotspots of disruption to communities and infrastructure, food in complex adaptive systems, and migration and community relocation. These pillars are interwoven with five component processes: education, outreach, local community engagement, international comparison and collaboration, and evaluation. Research integrates the pillars where system responses and uncertainties are predicted under several socio-environmental scenarios. Researchers from a variety of fields are coming together with local community members to conduct the research. The data and analysis created through surveying local community members, modeling environmental changes, and conducting economic research inform local, state, and national decision makers and leaders about how to address infrastructure and social needs in the face of environmental changes. In addition to the research and community focus of the project, POLARIS is training junior researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research as they participate in work across the pillars and five components. This helps ensure that the rising generation of researchers is well prepared to continue the crucial work to address the issues that the project identifies well past its conclusion.

Catalysts make and break molecular bonds, turning raw materials into useful products. With increased global demand for the products of these catalytic reactions, new and reimagined catalysts are essential to drive innovation and more effectively utilize our natural resources. Current strategies for developing catalysts rely mostly on time-intensive, trial-and-error experiments. Recent advances in computer science and machine learning have the potential to speed up discovery in this field by automating search mechanisms for these vastly complex and data-rich systems, ultimately revealing hidden patterns and physical properties that scientists can use to design novel catalysts. However, to initiate this data revolution in catalysis, highly skilled individuals are needed who are capable of collaborating across the chemical and computer sciences. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Kansas will address this need by training graduate students to harness data to ask and answer new questions needed for the discovery of safe, effective, and energy-efficient chemical conversion processes. The traineeship is designed to provide a unique, scalable and comprehensive training opportunity for fifty (50) MS and PhD students, including twenty-five (25) funded trainees, from chemical engineering, chemistry, and computer science.

This NRT program will lay the groundwork for developing novel data mining and extraction methodologies, which will in turn accelerate catalytic insights and innovations with potentially far-reaching advances in challenging chemistries such as water splitting and alkane oxidation. Decades of research in these chemistries have led to thousands of publications, yet breakthrough catalysts remain elusive.  With focused training in how to harness the plethora of data, researchers will establish new insights on catalyst structure-function patterns and correlations in catalytic materials, leading to potentially transformational advances in these chemistries. The research program will create modularized data mining frameworks and reveal machine learning techniques that can decipher complex property/activity relationships in other catalytic systems as well, ultimately establishing an Internet of Catalysis. This NRT program will prepare a future workforce of interdisciplinary scholars who are highly skilled communicators and leaders capable of excelling in a wide array of careers. Initiatives to promote active inclusion and graduate school resilience will transform the learning environment and encourage the full participation of women, underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities, and veterans. Key training components include team building with a global perspective, new courses and a certificate program, hypothesis-based career planning, inclusion and resilience training, and technical training.  This initiative will impact the training of graduate students across departments and institutions, contributing to the development and broad adoption of evidence-based teaching and learning practices for graduate education.

This project is aimed at training the next generation of scientists and leaders who can help build resilient communities that are prepared for, can effectively respond to, and can quickly recover from damaging hazard events. To better understand the complexities of resilience planning and improve predictability, methodological advancements that integrate multiple layers of information are critically needed. Specifically, progress requires a better understanding of the factors that impact resilience in natural, social, and built environmental systems; how these systems interact; and the effectiveness of specific resilience-based measures and communication strategies. In the absence of such advancements, disparities in the resilience of communities will persist, and decision-making efforts to reduce climate-related hazard impacts may be misguided. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Auburn University will prepare a future workforce that will build climate-related disaster resilience in the southeastern United States by training individuals at the MS and PhD levels. Students will conduct research within an integrated and multidisciplinary framework with the aim to better understand, predict, and communicate the resilience of natural, social and built environmental systems.

Likewise, advances in bioengineering promise to see the previously un-seeable and measure the previously immeasurable. This combination of ""Big Data"" and novel technological advances enables the investigation of fundamental principles in plant science at multiple scales. Interdisciplinary research in Digital Plant Science (DPS) leverages these advances by combining computational science, plant science and systems engineering approaches to respond to agricultural and ecological challenges. Accordingly, this next generation of graduate students must receive cross-disciplinary training in plant science, bioengineering, and computational biology to acquire the foundational skills to sense, capture, and measure information about plant processes in real time and at multiple scales, from microscopic single cells to entire ecosystems. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Cornell University will create a transformative experience that integrates interdisciplinary team learning and professional development to equip future plant scientists with the tools needed to investigate, comprehend, and engineer plant processes to improve plant productivity and sustainability in the 21st century. The project anticipates training 120 graduate students, including 18 funded trainees, from the graduate fields of Plant Biology, Plant Breeding, Plant Pathology, Soil and Crop Sciences, Biological and Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Computer Science.  

This project will create an interactive and innovative core curriculum that integrates plant science, computational science, and bioengineering, while disseminating this curriculum throughout and beyond the Cornell community. Graduate trainee learning through co-instruction will reinforce this core training. In addition, novel, team research rotation experiences will be utilized. Teams of three graduate students, mentored by cross-disciplinary faculty comprising computational scientists, bioengineers, and plant scientists, will collaborate to generate and analyze original ""Big Data"" in a group environment that simulates the team-based research approaches that typify industrial research and development settings. Graduate student training will be broadened to include the systematic development of communication and team-working skills that are essential for successful careers in multiple endeavors both within and outside of academia.

However, these graduates have limited knowledge as to how to translate those skills into approaches highly valued by companies, such as market evaluation, project management, product development, and finance. Given that an ever-increasing number of graduate students are pursuing employment in industry, the NC State Graduate School recently piloted a module-based training approach (Accelerate to Industry) with professional development opportunities that specifically address the transition from academia to industry. Training goals include developing graduate students' career awareness and exploration, entrepreneurial skills, ability to complete real-world work experiences, and, ultimately, career success in industry. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to North Carolina State University will allow broader testing of the Accelerate to Industry approach at diverse institutions. To expand to other universities, the project created scalable, modular activities intended to allow universities to implement the components that best fit their needs and resources. In addition, this project will establish a two-day train-the-trainer event for 10 new institutional partners annually that will focus specifically on providing graduate students with an immersive, industry-intensive learning experience. By implementing Accelerate to Industry within diverse institutions, the project will test the robustness and efficacy of the overall approach, the modular platform, and the professional development content. While mixed method assessment tools will address these broader questions, the most intensive cross-institutional assessment efforts will focus on delivery of the module from the train-the-trainers workshop that provides students with a week-long, industry-intensive immersive learning experience. If successful, this approach could provide a path forward for institutions to facilitate the successful transition of graduate students from academia to industry, and the study results will add to our understanding of best practices to support diverse career pathways for the nation's graduate population.

This graduate education research project will test and validate the Accelerate to Industry (A2i) approach at 30 universities representing Research 1, Research 2, and Masters-Intensive institutions. The range of institutional types will generate the data necessary to evaluate broader implementation and customization. The research is intended to advance academic knowledge in three areas: (1) the employment success derived from training STEM graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, across a variety of academic institutions through university-industry consortia; (2) the impact on employability through increased industry-relevant experiential learning, including interdisciplinary project-based experiences framed by Adult Learning Theory; and (3) the impact of facilitating industry workforce training through central administrative units (e.g., graduate schools), in contrast to more decentralized approaches (i.e., department or academic college level). Accordingly, this project will test four central hypotheses: (1) A2i participants will have increased employment and career success in industry tied to the skill development and interdisciplinary interactions offered by A2i as compared to those with no training; (2) given its flexibility and modular structure, A2i can be effectively developed in a range of different academic settings; (3) student participants value the programming afforded by A2i and feel more confident about their ability to succeed in industry; and (4) self-awareness of skills, interests, and values enhances A2i participants' learning and employment outcomes.

The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.

VR uses advanced display and immersive audio technologies to create an interactive, three-dimensional (3D) environment. AR uses digital technology to overlay virtual objects onto the physical world to provide information and embellish our experiences. Current and envisioned application areas include education, healthcare, professional training, architectural and product design, remote interaction, and entertainment. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of AR/VR requires researchers with Ph.D. training and research experience spanning multiple disciplines including electronic and computing systems, perceptual and cognitive neuroscience, optics and imaging, computer vision, acoustics and audio, and human-computer interfaces. To address this need and realize the transformative potential of AR/VR technologies, this National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) Award to the University of Rochester will facilitate the development of a structured, multi-disciplinary Ph.D. training program on AR/VR. The project anticipates training 62 PhD students, including 12 funded trainees, from Electrical and Computer Engineering, Optics, Biomedical Engineering, Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Computer Science, and Neuroscience. In addition, the project will benefit approximately 300 other STEM graduate students who will participate in aspects of the training and professional development. Trainees will gain the vision and skills to advance AR/VR technologies as well as an appreciation for the broader cultural and societal implications of these technologies. The project will train inclusive cohorts of scientists and engineers to contribute to society as technical leaders in industry, academia, and government.

The project will train a new cohort of Ph.D. students with a unique set of competencies in the AR/VR domain. It will help shape how future scientists and engineers will be trained not only in AR/VR but more broadly in human-data-system interfaces. The project will advance interdisciplinary research with an innovative theme:  integration of quantitative models of human perceptual-cognitive processes into cross-layer design approaches to create and quantitatively evaluate new AR/VR technologies and applications. Research thrusts integrated with the training program in a cross-cutting manner will advance the scientific foundations of AR/VR systems and impact the design of next-generation AR/VR systems. These research thrusts, corresponding to four layers of the AR/VR problem domain, are: (1) AR/VR platforms and computation, (2) perceptual-cognitive aspects of AR/VR design, (3) machine intelligence for AR/VR systems, and (4) AR/VR interfaces and applications. The training program contains three new innovative courses addressing the diverse backgrounds of incoming trainees, exposing them to AR/VR challenges and providing competency to work on AR/VR projects within multi-disciplinary teams as well as a variety of structured professional development activities. In addition, the training will include industry internships and immersive professional development encounters with industry leaders. Both the graduate training model and its outcomes will be widely disseminated to the broader academic community through organized events and a web presence.

The researcher will investigate manifestations of ableism, the act of privileging nondisabled people over those with disabilities, which is understood for the purposes of the investigation as an ethical issue. She will determine how ableist academic culture contributes to unethical systemic obstacles for achievement at the graduate level. To do so, she will interview graduate students with disabilities in computing and related fields. She will recruit current and former graduate students with a diverse representation across disabilities in computing and related fields from different institutions. She will also interview faculty who have advised such students, and representatives from different university disability services offices. She will use this data to develop a set of guidelines on how to address accessibility barriers in research are to be developed on the basis of the outcomes of this project. The guidelines will be disseminated to students, faculty advisors, and university disability services offices so they can begin to adopt anti-ableist language and strategies and actively incorporate inclusion in their work. Those who stand to benefit from the outcomes of this are not limited to those in computing; they will also be applicable to students and researchers in adjacent fields.

This is a research project to addresses a fundamental research question: How do academic expectations and relationships contravene ethical conduct and create barriers for disabled graduate students, and what guidance and resources effectively empower students and allies to engage equitable and anti-ableist practices to enable students to achieve success? To address this research question, we propose to use a qualitative research approach to analyze public-facing institutional disability service policies, and to interview disabled graduate students, faculty advisors, and disability services staff to understand how resources and attitudes toward disability create barriers for disabled students at the graduate level. The researcher will then critically analyze this qualitative data with an ethical anti-ableist lens and engage participatory design efforts to develop toolkits with guidelines and strategies that incorporate anti-ableist approaches for graduate students, faculty advisors, and disability service offices. The project will contribute knowledge about academic culture that may persist ableist barriers to success for disabled graduate students. Contributions of this work include empirical findings about how ableism manifests as barriers for graduate students, and a toolkit with guidelines that incorporate anti-ableist strategies for academic success for disabled students, faculty advisors and disability services offices. She will deploy toolkits to students, faculty and disability service offices and evaluate the effectiveness of the toolkits to provide useful anti-ableist strategies to empower students.

However, diversification at the graduate level remains a major challenge for many universities. What is needed is a comprehensive, scalable and cost-effective approach that can address: low ethnic/racial diversity; low doctoral degree completion rates, and inadequate preparation to succeed in graduate school and pursue academic, private sector and professional careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Nevada, Reno will test a novel recruitment, retention and career preparedness approach for increasing the representation of first-generation college students and students from historically underrepresented groups in STEM graduate education.  Students will be engaged in two 3-week summer boot camps as well as additional professional development, mentoring, and social network support activities during the first 1.5 years of graduate school.  Unique elements of this project include (1) intentional development of a recruitment/retention positive feedback loop, (2) family/community involvement to enhance support groups, and (3) training in marketable skills (e.g. communication via virtual reality platforms). Outcomes from this project will generate new knowledge concerning best practices for recruitment and retention of historically underrepresented populations.  

While this project is broadly focused on recruitment, retention and career preparedness for historically underrepresented groups of graduate students, there are five major areas being addressed.  Specifically, the project will test interventions and compare results across control and test groups to examine potential changes in: (1) academic performance and research quality, (2) non-financial family support, (3) ease of navigation toward degree completion and career placement, (4) recruitment and retention, and (5) student research and communication skills. Interventions include quantitative disciplinary and transferrable skills modules, social support networks and enhanced mentoring and mentor training.  Formative/summative assessment and hypothesis testing procedures will include surveys, academic performance comparisons, course evaluations, focus groups, one-on-one interviews, social network interviews, FIG (Family Involvement in Graduate School) assessment of students/family members and National Resource Mentoring Network surveys of faculty members. Interventions will be evaluated individually and collectively to determine whether student and faculty participation enhanced graduate education outcomes, improved mentor/mentee relationships and enhanced recruitment of historically underrepresented groups and first-generation students through positive feedback loops.

In addition, society needs a more diverse science workforce, as creative and robust scientific and technological advances result from more diverse scientific teams. With the right approach, we can train diverse basic science graduate students in data science to fill these workforce needs. This National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to San Francisco State University will evaluate a novel, modular approach for inclusive graduate education to advance data science skills in the basic sciences. The Graduate Opportunities to Learn Data science (GOLD) strategy will support basic science Masters students, focusing on women and students from historically underrepresented groups, to (1) learn computational and statistical skills, (2) apply those skills to their research projects, and (3) form strong learning and networking communities. This new approach will create inclusive environments that prepare diverse students to obtain the interdisciplinary skills necessary to boost their career development. The GOLD program is modular, so successful components can easily be adopted at other universities, creating the potential for a significant impact on graduate education. 

The Graduate Opportunities to Learn Data science (GOLD) strategy will be implemented through a 12-unit interdisciplinary certificate program. The program includes a 9-unit series of courses that will teach programming and data science, using assignments and examples drawn from biology and chemistry research. A 1-unit class taken twice will help students to apply these skills to their own thesis research supported by peer-mentors. A 1-unit professional development class will connect students with local computational biologists and chemists working in academia and industry, helping the students network and contextualize their training. To ensure an inclusive environment, GOLD will (1) use validated methods to mitigate well-known barriers that alienate many women and underrepresented students entering high-tech fields and (2) provide faculty professional development on inclusive teaching strategies, active learning, and mentoring. The success of the GOLD strategy will be assessed based on five student outcomes using a mixed methods approach: acquisition of computational skills, application of computational skills, career goals, perception of inclusive learning environments, and scientific identity. Outcomes will contribute to the current state of pedagogy in graduate education and enable successful implementation of similar programs.

The project team will pilot and test a new, replicable model for creating an expandable consortium in STEM graduate education, designed to increase the breadth and frequency of course offerings and educational opportunities available to a diverse group of students. The new model, Rapid, proposes an innovative delineation of the elements required to successfully set up a consortium, covering a range of activities from curriculum planning to financial agreements, consortium management and governance, student support systems and course delivery, and including future consortium expansion and sustainability. Also innovative is its goal to create a consortium that is readily able to add new members, and the inclusion of webinars shared among consortium members and international partner organizations for swift diffusion of new knowledge. As universities respond to society's demand for educational programs in rapidly evolving technical fields, models for multi-university, multi-disciplinary consortiums such as Rapid provide critical pathways for success. 

The main objective of the project is to pilot and test the Rapid model, and to add to the knowledge base in how to effectively establish a consortium. The Rapid model is a new facilitation model developed from evidence-based models described in the literature and implemented in practice. The goal of the project is to study the pilot-test of the Rapid model as applied to a consortium in wind energy graduate education (WindU). Questions guiding this research study are: 1) How was the Rapid model used for developing a consortium in STEM graduate education? and, 2) In what ways was the Rapid model effective for consortium development? The project team will use a design and development research process described in the Common Guidelines for Education Research and Development to provide real-time evidence for model pilot-testing during consortium development and, ultimately, for identifying the final model for dissemination.

The project will test whether such an approach can enhance creativity and collaborative problem-solving skills beyond the boundaries of the classroom and beyond an individual discipline. The goal is to train students in best practices for team-based research by providing a versatile skill set to address team processes and interpersonal issues and foster synergy towards arriving at creative solutions that exceed those achieved by a collection of individuals.

Two graduate courses will be developed in creativity to explicitly expose students to creative practices and problem-solving strategies within an interdisciplinary team space.  The two courses will allow students to discover recent advances in creativity research and practice. During the courses, students will apply these principles by devising team-based solutions to STEM-related societal problems and by creatively improving student thesis research. The project has an implementation component to ensure smooth integration across university disciplines and a research component that evaluates the effectiveness of the courses in enhancing creativity, problem-solving and team practices. The research component will examine student, peer, and faculty stakeholders using a mixed-methods, longitudinal approach to generate formative and summative assessments.

Briefly stated, research identity refers to the ways in which graduate students define themselves as researchers and is an important factor in student success. Specifically, this project will implement and test approaches to foster research identity development for graduate students in non-research-intensive institutions. It should be noted that smaller institutions/programs often face deficiencies that can impact the ability of faculty mentors to foster student research identities both individually and as part of a larger group. In engineering, a faculty advisor generally guides the graduate research experience and the advisor is the primary resource to help graduate students develop their identities as engineering researchers.  Given this apprenticeship model, the mentoring and guidance that a student receives in developing a professional identity is largely dependent on the style, resources, and graduate student group size of the faculty mentor.  This project is testing interventions that could potentially overcome these limitations, particularly for students in smaller graduate programs.

This study on engineering research identity will be conducted at a Carnegie R2 institution (NCAT), a leading producer of African-American engineers, and it will implement a three-pronged approach that is grounded in sociological and psychological theories of identity.   The project entails (1) establishing a Research Engineer Network that will help graduate students develop a research engineer identity; (2) forming Small Research Groups of faculty members with common interests who will foster students' research skills; and (3) designing and administering a survey-based Research Engineer Identity scale and assessment using a mixed-methods research design that includes focus groups, structured interviews, and web-based surveys. The design will culminate with a quasi-experimental test comparing the development of research identify among students participating in the study and a control group of matched students. The three coordinated innovations in this project will collectively build and assess an innovative infrastructure for developing research identify in graduate engineering students. It is anticipated that the project results will be applicable to universities broadly, while particularly informing practice in smaller graduate programs.

The new data revolution calls for a new data-savvy workforce capable of using data effectively to answer important scientific and practical questions and to communicate the results to a broad audience. These data scientists should have strong technical and leadership skills and the ability to work in teams comprising different and complementary expertise. To meet this training need, the National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to Tufts University will test an innovative approach to project-based learning, teaching graduate students in data-intensive fields using real datasets to solve real-world problems. This solution-oriented, student-led, team-based, computationally-enriched (SOLSTICE) training environment will offer multidisciplinary team role-play and experience in data analytics and scientific communication. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of the SOLSTICE approach in providing an adaptable method for instructors in a range of fields that use large datasets at diverse institution types. As the SOLSTICE approach is refined, it will pave the way for students to enter the workforce with strong technical skills in data analytics and be effective members of research teams. 

The project will answer two overarching research questions: (1) To what extent does the SOLSTICE approach provide opportunities for students to achieve 21st-century data intensive knowledge, skills, and attitudes? and (2) Are there variations in students' achievement over time, across different courses that use the SOLSTICE approach, and across different STEM disciplines? The approach consists of three components: (1) 3D Role Play, in which each student plays the role of Team Lead, Collaborator, and Reviewer in three different interdisciplinary teams aiming to develop, execute and communicate a research project based on authentic secondary data analyses; (2) Feedback on Feedback, which provides students with experience in giving and receiving effective critiques to their peers to strengthen inter-team communication; and (3) Data Analysis Roadmap, which offers knowledge-building guides and examples of key elements for efficient data analysis plans and other documents needed for effective communication of results. The approach will be tested and evaluated in six data-intensive courses in the Friedman School of Nutrition and in the School of Engineering, with approximately 270 participants monitored before, during, and for at least six months after participation in a SOLSTICE-based course. Educational resources will be developed based on successful components to guide replications of the training process, to train faculty in the SOLSTICE approach, and to disseminate it to other STEM fields.

They must also be able to think creatively, to collaborate across disciplines, and to work with people with different perspectives, knowledge, and values. There is compelling evidence that creativity training can stimulate both scientific creativity and interdisciplinary collaboration, but to date, little attention has been given to creativity training in STEM graduate education. This National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Georgia will bring a diverse group of graduate students together from STEM and arts disciplines to address issues in the local watershed using creativity-based training methods from the arts. This project will investigate the impact of targeted creativity training on the ability of STEM students to frame problems in new ways and help diverse teams solve complex problems. If successful, widespread adoption of these methods will contribute to equipping STEM graduates across the country with communication and collaboration skills and ultimately increase creative and innovative solutions to complex global environmental challenges.

Over each of five semesters, this project will recruit a cohort of ten students in the early stages of graduate study, five from STEM disciplines who self-identify as interested in environmental science, and five from arts disciplines. Cohorts will meet for six workshops facilitated by two faculty members from STEM and arts disciplines. Workshops are designed to build core creative competencies and develop skills for collaborative interdisciplinary practice. Students will gain practical experience sharing disciplinary viewpoints, creating analogies from scientific concepts, and developing collaborative frameworks for complex problem solving. The final workshop will result in a set of proposed solutions to a local watershed problem, collaboratively identified by students and stakeholders. Complementary quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to examine students' abilities to shift thinking (increase ""cognitive flexibility""), generate novel ideas, and effectively communicate and collaborate with one another. This project seeks to fundamentally enhance how STEM students are educated by engaging them in creative processes related to their research topics. Successful elements will be incorporated into a scalable training model that will be widely disseminated and available for adoption at other institutions.

These aerial migrations have fascinated people for millennia; however, given the difficulty of tracking animals flying through the open skies, little is known about the rules that govern life in the air. Human activities have local and global impacts on these migrations by eliminating stopover habitats where migrants rest and refuel during their hazardous journeys and by altering atmospheric conditions. This project asks whether aerial migrants can keep pace with these rapid changes and what traits make some migrants more adaptable to change than others. The collaborative team of biologists and meteorologists will develop and employ advanced animal tracking methods to reveal both the precise locations of birds during migratory flights and the atmospheric conditions they fly through. This tracking will include novel microsensors placed on birds and aerial vehicles to collect heretofore-elusive data streams that reveal the environment experienced by birds in flight. The research team will combine these new observations with weather radar data from across the U.S. that already captures massive quantities of data on migrating birds, bats, and insects as they fly over the countryside. This combination of new and existing data may yield novel insights into migrant behavior within their changing atmospheric habitats. By bringing together scientists across disciplines, this research will develop and test different ways to enhance communication, collaboration, and teamwork among the next generation of students and their teachers. Finally, this project will communicate to the public how the changing environment influences the timing of migration over and through their communities.  Workshops in schools and community centers and work with local landowners will foster ""citizen science"" and adaptive strategies to contribute to this national effort. 

To uncover scaling rules that control phenology of life in the air, this study implements a research framework that integrates the spatiotemporal rescaling hypothesis and the metabolic theory of ecology. From this basis the study predicts that seasonal phenology of aerial migration is accelerating in response to environmental changes and that small-bodied migrants should have a greater capacity to speed up migration than larger-bodied migrants. The project studies the central flyway of North America and focuses on the impact of the central plains low-level jet on aerial migration patterns. The low-level jet is a prominent feature of the North American atmosphere to which many aerial migrants are known to be highly adapted. Recent evidence that the low-level jet is both expanding in geographic scope and intensity provides an ideal context for testing the study's predictions. The project team will leverage existing open-access and newly collected data from two coincident aerial migration systems; nocturnal bird and insect migration. Sensors for tracking location and atmospheric conditions will be placed on migratory birds that span two orders of magnitude in body size. Integrated biological and meteorological data will be used to improve our understanding of the rescaling of the low-level jet and to test predictions about how that rescaling impacts the phenology of life in the air.

In recent years, IDPs have been adapted to support the career and professional development of graduate students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Despite an interdisciplinary consensus that IDPs, when used properly, provide a framework for helping graduate students achieve their career goals, there is little alignment among STEM disciplines and institutions about the specific, measurable outcomes of IDP use. This knowledge gap inhibits the availability of reliable effective practices for IDP use and its wide adoption among educators. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the American Chemical Society will help define core goals for the IDP process used across STEM disciplines and help develop tools that measure the impact of IDPs on the professional development of graduate students in STEM. The project outcomes will catalyze the generation of evidence for effective use of IDPs - evidence that is needed to scale the use of the IDP process, support and inform additional investments in career planning and graduate education, and foster growth of the field of PhD career development. Ultimately, results from this project have the potential to improve educational outcomes in graduate education and to better prepare the U.S. workforce. 

This project will work nationally across STEM disciplines to align activities associated with implementing and measuring the impact of the IDP process, fulfilling three project objectives: (1) define core goals and measurable outcomes for the IDP process; (2) develop and test a set of instruments for demonstrating changes in student actions and attitudes resulting from use of the IDP process; and (3) recommend strategies for building a base of evidence on how and why the IDP process works in various contexts.

Initial drafts of the instruments will be created based on prior research, interviews with a range of STEM stakeholders, and feedback from career planning professionals and assessment experts. The collection of psychometric surveys and other tools will be pre-tested using cognitive interviews, field-tested with students from various graduate programs and backgrounds, and pilot-tested at selected campuses with a statistically relevant number of graduate students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Stakeholder interviews, input from gatherings of subject matter experts, insights from and surveys of those attending discussions with and presentations to the STEM graduate education and career development communities, focus groups of graduate students, and results from use of the tool-kit will be among the methods used to test two project hypotheses: (1) a set of instruments can be developed to measure the impacts of the IDP process as it is used in different ways to guide students with different backgrounds, experiences, and career goals; and (2) engaging a range of stakeholders, nationally and at academic institutions, in developing and testing this set of instruments will form a cadre that is interested and invested in using the project findings, resources, and recommendations to build a broader and more robust research base on the effective use and impact of the IDP process on graduate students.

Students have primarily been prepared for academic career paths although a significant proportion of STEM graduate students go on to non-academic careers. Therefore, it is vital to focus graduate education efforts on preparing a new type of scholar - one with a strong professional identity and a flexible set of tools - rather than preparing a person for a specific type of career. Although often neglected in traditional graduate education, the development of a student's professional identity is proven to raise retention rates and promote academic success, particularly for underrepresented students. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Boise State University will test an educational model that supports the cultivation of STEM graduate students' professional identities through collaboration with undergraduate education majors and elementary students in STEM learning. The teaching and communication skills that graduate students develop through the project will be transferable to diverse career paths.

GIFT (Graduate Identity Formation through Teaching) focuses on the promotion of graduate student professional identity via the concept of disciplinary stewardship, wherein professionals learn not only the knowledge and skills of their discipline, but also how their discipline connects to and serves society as a whole. Through a one credit hour course, graduate students will develop a deeper understanding of pedagogy, as well as issues related to teaching and learning. The graduate students simultaneously serve as disciplinary experts as they teach elementary teacher candidates specific topics related to the Next Generation Science Standards. The teacher candidates subsequently turn this knowledge into 15-minute mini-lessons for elementary students at a local Title I school. Based on interdisciplinary collaborations with four STEM departments at Boise State, spread over six semesters, it is anticipated that this effort will provide a transferable, low/no-cost model for future interventions that support graduate students more broadly. A comprehensive, longitudinal research plan employing both quantitative and qualitative data will enable analysis of the intervention with respect to: graduate student professional identity development, including variability across student demographics/attributes; graduate faculty advisors' attitudes/outlooks on the purposes of graduate education; and the impact of the academic disciplinary context/setting on the design of the intervention, and hence its scalability and transferability. This work stands to contribute to the fields of graduate education, educational opportunities, and STEM education research.

Because this industry will change how we interact with each other, this topic will present new policy, economic, and environmental issues to solve. The National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to William Marsh Rice University will address these challenges by training graduate doctoral students in the interdisciplinary field of bioelectronics.

Students typically begin training in disciplinary graduate programs, and collaboration follows after investing significant time into defining the research problem, often through co-mentored apprenticeships. This educational model is thought to limit the kinds of questions that students pursue because students are not poised to effectively integrate into the type of teams required for bioelectronics innovation. To overcome these limitations, this NRT program will integrate a team-first pedagogical model for doctoral training with bioelectronics research to educate students about past interdisciplinary innovations, theoretical underpinnings of interdisciplinarity, creation of cohesive teams and community building, frameworks for achieving conceptual understanding across disciplines, and strategies to understand the needs of stakeholders. Research activities centered on bioelectronics themes encompass diverse topics, such as light-harvesting systems that enable chemical synthesis within cells, instruments that monitor complex electrical signaling in the nervous system, and living sensors that interface with handheld devices.

This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Miami University will pilot and test a Graduate Student Learning Community (GSLC) model aimed at closing that gap.  This innovative approach to STEM graduate student mentoring synthesizes knowledge from the scholarship of teaching and learning, psychology, and chemistry education to build a robust year-long experience. The goals of the project are to develop the STEM graduate students' sense of identity, sense of community, and ability to communicate with non-scientists. Beyond positively influencing the participants in the GSLC, the project will advance graduate education in a number of ways. First, the members of the GSLC are themselves actors within their specific research groups, departments, and professions; greater identity clarity, community, and communication skills among these students can in turn positively impact their broader cultures. Second, the curriculum in this project can be implemented and tailored to meet the needs of graduate students at other universities. Finally, the focused attention on communicating to non-specialists will increase the potential reach of STEM topics to scientists outside of one's own specialty and to the broader public.

This project will develop an interdisciplinary Graduate Student Learning Community (GSLC). In two cohorts, each one year in length, this project will mentor and enhance the skills of STEM graduate students in chemistry and psychology. As part of the GSLC, the two cohorts of STEM graduate students will develop individualized professional development plans; receive regular career mentoring; and participate in an evidence-based curriculum designed to explore their professional identity, build community, and improve their ability to communicate with non-specialists. The project will specifically test the effectiveness of the GSLC model to foster professional identity, sense of community, and communication skills.  Evaluation will involve comparison within cohorts using pre-and post-assessments, as well as against a control group of non-participants. The curriculum developed in this project will be transferable across disciplines and universities thereby broadening the impact on STEM graduate education.

While many of the skills and competencies needed for both types of research are overlapping or complementary, graduate students may not have the opportunity to fully explore industry-related skillsets and mindsets in a traditional academic setting.  Stronger collaboration between industry and academia can bridge this gap, with most institutional approaches involving a short-term industry internship. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Lehigh University will test a graduate training model that represents a student-centered, holistic approach that gives students long-term, hands-on industry experience.  A key feature of the approach is early and sustained industry engagement, with industry partners involved in identification of the research question that forms for the basis for the student's thesis, mentoring, delivery of professional development modules, and supervision of students during a company residency (similar to medical school training).  This approach is patterned after successful programs in France, Germany and the UK, with the intent of testing the model in the United States.  It is hypothesized that the approach will train graduate students more effectively to engage in use-inspired research and prepare them with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in an industrial setting. 

The project will pilot and test several key features of this use-inspired research training model: (a) a pre-program summer experience with a company to identify a research topic; (b) co-advisers from the university and partner company; (c) modular, graduate-level professional development co-taught by faculty and industry researchers; and (d) a one to two semester company residency. The effectiveness of these four elements will be assessed using a mixed-methods approach, with an eye toward critical student skillsets identified through a gap analysis with industry partners.

The priorities and next steps identified through this workshop will seed future initiatives and enable STEM doctoral programs to more effectively and efficiently address the training needs for the next generation of scientists.

The one-and-a-half-day workshop will focus on an area that is consistently highlighted as a need in national reports on STEM graduate education, but which has received little attention: the lack of a national infrastructure for coordinating and curating dissemination of materials supporting innovative doctoral educational models. The workshop will bring together stakeholders with expertise spanning dissemination, evaluation, career development, and graduate education, to define actionable next steps for enhancing the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based educational approaches for PhD career development. This workshop will use panel presentations, stakeholder-focused group discussions, mixed-expertise small group discussions, and full group report-outs to define the most critical issues and recommended actions for dissemination of evidence-based practices. The workshop will generate a list of the needs, challenges, and barriers to dissemination and implementation of educational models, informed by the diverse viewpoints of key stakeholder groups, and will identify a list of recommended next steps, including how each stakeholder group can contribute to enhancing evaluation and dissemination of approaches. The workshop will result in a report synthesizing findings, including actionable next steps focused on individual, stakeholder group, and national efforts.

The project anticipates training approximately seventy (70) PhD students, including thirty-eight (38) funded trainees from plant biology and computational data science programs. 

Trainees will engage in research and coursework that emphasize tackling ""grand challenge"" questions in plant biology by leveraging computational approaches. Training will go beyond the traditional genomics and bioinformatics approaches in plant biology to include the advanced training in computation and modeling required to handle increasingly heterogeneous, multi-scale data from the molecular to ecosystem levels.  This type of training will allow students to tackle complex questions such as investigating genotype-phenotype relationships across the Plant Tree of Life or machine learning for high-dimensional plant data.  In addition, the traineeship features professional development opportunities, outreach activities, and industry/governmental internships that serve to broaden trainees' career options while also improving their ability to communicate with a wide range of audiences. Upon completion of the training program, trainees will have a core understanding of plant and computational sciences, excel in interdisciplinary biological and computational research, and possess effective communication, leadership, management, teaching, and mentoring skills. Trainees will be co-advised by experts in plant science and computational/data science. To accomplish the training goals, trainees will participate in a program consisting of: (1) curricular and research activities that will create a cohort of trainees with dual expertise in computational sciences and plant biology, (2) a biweekly forum to encourage scientific interactions, (3) a trainee-led annual symposium that engages a wider scientific audience and builds organizational and leadership skills, (4) internship opportunities in industry and government agencies, (5) professional development activities tailored to individual career goals, including entrepreneurship, and (6) public engagement through outreach activities, further bolstering the ability of trainees to communicate with a wide range of audiences.

This issue might be circumvented by replacing traditional ""one-size-fits-all"" course content with personalized electronic training modules that are tailored to each student's unique strengths, weaknesses, and training goals.  This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education award to Penn State University aims to develop, test, and refine a set of digital educational tools brought together by the Individualized Pathways and Resources to Adaptive Control Theory-Inspired Scientific Education system (iPRACTISE). The goal of iPRACTISE is to direct each student toward a personally optimized training pathway for mastery of data science techniques. The iPRACTISE system will allow students to specify their own learning goals, provide customized assessments to evaluate their performance levels, and guide them to educational resources that help them reach their goals. In this way, the iPRACTISE system serves as an initial proof-of-concept for a personalized, digital graduate educational system that could be adapted for use in a broad array of educational settings to enhance individual learning.

Personalized education can be viewed as a control theory problem in which students seek ongoing input, such as classes, curricular resources and training exercises to minimize the discrepancies between their actual and targeted levels of expertise. The iPRACTISE system will include: (1) digital training materials curated from existing teaching resources and a user-interface for instructors to populate the system with new training materials; (2) a user interface to specify training goals; (3) a computerized assessment system that evaluates students' current ability levels; and (4) control theory algorithms that automate the delivery of optimal, individualized training modules. The project will collect test data from a calibration sample consisting of graduate and advanced undergraduate students from multiple campuses at Penn State University to develop and test the assessment system (for evaluating student competency) and the control theory algorithm (for making personalized recommendations on training contents). After initial calibration, the iPRACTISE system offerings will be expanded and learning outcomes compared across diverse student cohorts.

The traineeship anticipates training one hundred fifty-eight (158) master's and doctoral students, including thirty-three (33) funded PhD trainees, from civil and environmental engineering, computer science, electrical and computer engineering, mechanical and aerospace engineering, and systems and information engineering.

Current CPS graduate training is lacking in three critical ways that will be addressed in this project. First, current courses do not instill the integrative knowledge needed for new scientific discovery and translational applications in the field of CPS. Second, most students do not have a sufficiently robust experience of convergence activities as part of their training. This lack exists not only in traditional engineering and computing education but also extends into analyses of target application domains and associated grand challenges. Third, explicit professional development is absent in most graduate training. Such exposure is critical in CPS given the field's potent role in our ever-evolving smart world, and CPS practitioners must attend to social issues regarding ethics, safety, privacy, communication, and policy. This traineeship will address these issues and drive CPS graduate education nationwide by developing a novel, comprehensive graduate training program that involves orientation, normalization modules, elective courses, experiential convergence research activities, professional development workshops, and a hands-on, testbed-driven educational curriculum. Students will acquire both the technical depth and the integrative transdisciplinary understanding of CPS and its associated application domains to be successful in CPS-related careers. During their time in the program, trainees will engage in transdisciplinary CPS research on projects related to challenges in smart health, smart cities, and autonomous systems.  These research efforts have the potential for significant scientific and application impact, such that a smarter world can be achieved and associated societal grand challenges can be addressed.

This is a major concern because irrigated farms contribute to approximately half of US crop sales, greater crop yields, reduced poverty, affordable food, and positive health and nutrition outcomes.  Water conservation alone is not enough.  Unconventional water resources must be used, but the overwhelming barrier is energy cost. The energy sector is undergoing a significant transformation as a result of the incorporation of renewable wind and solar energy. There is an opportunity of increasingly available renewable energy to provide inexpensive and plentiful water for water-stressed agricultural lands.  This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Texas at Austin will train a new generation of students to develop transformative and globally relevant solutions to use unconventional water resources for agriculture by harnessing power from renewable energy and recovering energy-containing resources from ""dirty"" water.  Technical skills alone are insufficient to advance these efforts, so trainees will be taught to think critically, understand technical, financial and societal challenges to technology implementation, and communicate complex ideas freely, and at the appropriate level, with stakeholders from all walks of life. The project anticipates training a diverse cohort of thirty-six (36) MS and PhD students, including eighteen (18) funded trainees, from engineering, geosciences, and public affairs.  

Project goals are to develop and institutionalize a new model in STEM education that directly supports and informs research activities, professional development, and societal improvement; to develop transformative water solutions for agriculture through interdisciplinary research; and to enhance graduate student and workforce diversity.  The new educational model consists of five program elements: (1) four core courses plus a food-energy-water systems (FEWS) seminar, (2) personalized professional development activities in communication, management, entrepreneurship, and job preparation, (3) dual-faculty and alumni mentoring of trainees, (4) FEWS-relevant internships, and (5) local public service. The courses and seminar will be institutionalized through a new FEWS certificate program, and the professional development activities will become a permanent institutional element through a portfolio program. A key novelty of the traineeship is complementing classroom knowledge with experiential learning through internship and public service.  The research effort will advance disruptive technology development in new materials, water treatment processes, and renewable energy sources; decision support modeling for integration of energy and water treatment processes; and global assessment of policy and technology diffusion.  Diversity will be enhanced by outreach and recruiting at four minority-serving institutions in Texas, and through direct collaboration with Prairie View A&M University, where trainees will engage with faculty and undergraduates to do field work in sustainable agriculture.

These ecosystems, however, are threatened by extreme weather events, changes in land use, habitat fragmentation, and species loss. The expertise to understand the impacts of such threats will require teams who collectively bring to bear modern methods in ecology, data and information processing, computing, statistics, and mathematical modeling. However, such team-based, scientific approaches are rare in formal graduate education programs. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Northern Arizona University will address these challenges by developing a team-based graduate training program in ecological and environmental informatics, with a focus on team-based research combined with the development of strong expert and public communication skills and modern collaborative skills broadly applicable beyond academia. The project anticipates training forty-eight (48) PhD students, including twenty-four (24) funded trainees, with an additional 100 graduate students (MS and PhD) benefiting from various aspects of the NRT training program.

This NRT training program is couched in the interdisciplinary research theme of understanding and forecasting the properties and processes of terrestrial ecosystems, especially the impact of and feedbacks to global change. The field is being flooded with data (e.g., from various ecological and Earth observatory networks) that are critical to understanding and forecasting terrestrial ecosystem responses. However, most graduate students and scientists lack the quantitative, computational, and collaborative skills to leverage such data to address grand, challenging questions. This NRT program will train the next generation of scientists to overcome these limitations, with a focus on training in informatics tools and team-science skills that facilitate solutions to complex problems, motivated by the question: How does anthropogenic global change affect the health and productivity of terrestrial ecosystems? In this innovative graduate training program, trainees will create their own scientist profile in ecological and environmental informatics by building substantive depth in a primary core competency and establishing breadth in other primary and supporting areas. The primary areas include data analytics and computing, analysis and synthesis, and terrestrial ecosystem science; the supporting areas include relevant data collection tools and products as well as skillsets in communication, collaboration, and team building. Key elements of this NRT program are scalable and sustainable, including: (1) a curriculum that allows students to personalize their training, (2) workshops, courses, and other activities that focus on team skills and applying these skills to collaborative research projects, (3) preparation for a range of careers via professional development and applied internship opportunities, and (4) the graduate ecological and environmental informatics certificate that is accessible to students in a range of STEM fields.

This traditional approach to graduate education leaves PhD students unprepared to enter the non-academic workforce upon graduation. A lack of adequate preparation not only adversely affects the students themselves, but also leads to missed opportunities for society, since STEM PhD students often have precisely the deep technical background needed to solve the growing number of data-driven problems society faces. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Duke University will test whether Master-level data science programs, which usually have curricula that emphasize the professional skills and applied data skills missing from most PhD programs, can be leveraged to improve the preparation of PhD students. This project will test the outcomes of combining the applied approach of Master-level data science programs with the depth and experience of PhD STEM students. More specifically, it will determine which aspects of Master-level professional curricula translate to PhD students. The results will provide guidance on approaches to extend the impact of a growing investment in data science Master programs to doctoral-level students and will inform the education community on better preparing the next generation of STEM scientists to work with and improve methods surrounding big data. In so doing, this project will help strengthen the pipeline between universities and non-academic employers. 

This project will incorporate a select cohort of Duke's STEM PhD students into Duke's Master in Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS) Capstone projects with non-academic partners, and include the selected PhD students in the professional development activities of the MIDS program. Duke's MIDS program emphasizes comprehensive training in professional and communication skills in its coursework. The program culminates in a capstone project that requires students to solve a data-driven problem for a partner outside of the university. Students must apply the technical skills, theoretical knowledge, and professional skills they learned in the classroom to a real-life situation that requires interacting with a diversity of both technical and non-technical collaborators. The goal of this research is to determine which of these enhanced experiences can mitigate - and ultimately, overcome - the shortage of doctoral graduates with industry-relevant training, developed professional competencies, and deep domain knowledge. The principles guiding this IGE project stem from research on the use of vertically-integrated, topically-focused research teams as mechanisms to motivate effective, meaningful learning. The MIDS Capstone curriculum is based on evidence-backed practices from the team-based learning and service learning literature. The effectiveness of the project for STEM PhD students will be evaluated using survey, interview, and structured assessment data collected from students, faculty, and Capstone partners, as well as data from potential future employers and students' supervisors after they move to new positions. Outcomes measured will include students' professional skills, students' data science competencies, students' research accomplishments, and reported benefits to non-academic partners. The results will be used to develop scalable mechanisms for universities to extend the impact of their investment in data science Master programs to doctoral-level students. Doing so will strengthen the potential for PhD students to deploy their expertise to solve society's most pressing problems both inside and outside of academia and will provide richer opportunities for organizations to find data scientists with the specialized knowledge needed to solve problems within their area.

To develop appropriate technologies and to enhance FEW system management, the next generation of analysts and researchers must be trained to develop a system-level understanding of FEW issues.  This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Colorado State University will address this need by undertaking research and training focused on FEW systems in semi-arid regions.  The project will prepare a diverse cohort of graduate students with the transdisciplinary skills and knowledge necessary to make meaningful contributions to the complex and changing interactions in FEW systems.

Graduate education in engineering typically produces engineers who are highly competent technicians, but who may lack the ability to understand and successfully navigate those contexts.  Important skills that may help engineers bring contextual perspectives into their problem solving include the ability to integrate across disciplines, to devise solutions to poorly-defined challenges, and to recognize and address broader societal and global issues.  This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Texas Tech University will test an approach designed to change the way graduate students in engineering conceptualize and reason about their work to better prepare them for real-world complexity.  The project will use innovative methods, informed by arts and humanities education and grounded in the learning sciences, to help students become more reflective thinkers who have greater awareness of the complex, broader contexts of their work. 
                                                   
The project will employ arts- and humanities-informed learning activities within the engineering curriculum to help students better understand the social and community aspects of engineering by becoming more reflective thinkers.   The curriculum will include activities such as visual thinking strategies to develop observational skills, computer-simulated ethical/moral dilemmas to prepare for real world complexity, and team projects to practice reflective engineering.  The purpose of these techniques is to enhance reflective reasoning and connect that reasoning to engineering.  This project will assess how the curriculum changes the student's ability to think reflectively, how the curriculum changes the way the student thinks about the role of engineers within a societal context, and what factors limit or enhance the ability of the student to benefit from the curriculum.  A mixed-methods approach will be used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention including surveys, formative peer assessment, interviews, narrative inquiry, and textual analysis.  The teaching and learning techniques that are the most effective in building reflective reasoning will be identified and refined and the results will be used to strengthen and broaden the impact of the curriculum. Publications and workshops conducted for other faculty and teaching-assistants will be used to disseminate the key findings from the project and aid translation of the research to other settings and institutions.  The ultimate goal of the research project is to create an impactful, evidence-based curriculum that educates future engineers who are committed to serving the public not only with technical engineering skills but with a mindfulness of the complex social, cultural, and environmental contexts impacting their work.

Scientists and engineers are generally not taught how to engage with the community as part of their research. teaching, or other long-term career goals. Graduate students often do not know how to access training in community engagement, are unaware of its importance, and/or lack the confidence or experience to take part. This project, the Public Service Fellows Program, will test a year-long professional development program as a means to prepare graduate students to view public service as a responsibility that comes with their scientific training. It will provide practical experience working with community partners on science-focused issues and projects. Integrating public service into STEM graduate student training will improve the practice of future generations of scientists by teaching the specific skills and mindsets needed for community engagement. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Wisconsin-Madison will strengthen ties between the scientific community and the public by training science and engineering graduate students to develop meaningful relationships and impactful, mutually beneficial projects with a wide variety of community partners. Graduate students from any STEM discipline will be able to incorporate issues of public concern into their career goals, whether they will pursue careers in academia, education, outreach, business, or policy. 

The model being tested is a ""Learn, Prepare, Implement"" sequence where public service fellows will experience increasing levels of independence, beginning with a grounding in foundational knowledge and progressing to a science-focused practicum experience working directly with a community partner. Fellows will be able to design their experience around one of four tracks: community-engaged teaching, direct service, policy, and social enterprise. Assessment will focus on two primary research questions: (1) What are graduate students' motivations to participate in the Public Service Fellows Program? and (2) How do students' professional identities change as a result of participation in the Public Service Fellows Program, and what component(s) of the program are primary contributors to these changes? The hypotheses are that community engagement will become a more integrated part of the fellows' professional identities, that graduate students who participate in the program will have an increased commitment to a community-engagement, regardless of career path, and that the biggest impact will be due to the in-depth practicum portion of the Public Service Fellows Program.

Yet past experience suggests that paths from technological innovation to improved sustainability and productivity entail considerable complexity and uncertainty. Meeting challenges of improving food, energy and water (FEW) systems requires the integration of knowledge from a number of natural sciences as well as from social, political, and ethical domains. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to North Carolina State University will provide graduate students who are enrolled in diverse natural and social science masters and PhD programs with the interdisciplinary knowledge and approaches needed to help forge futures where agricultural biotechnology applications enhance FEW systems while minimizing unintended consequences. In all, the AgBioFEWS program will train at least sixty-two (62) masters and PhD students, including twenty-two (22) funded PhD students, from biological, agricultural, and social sciences. The traineeship program will partner with two historically black universities, offering internships to their students, and will establish a path for these students to join the NRT program. Continuous interaction with experts from industry, government, and non-profit agencies will expose students to diverse career paths. 

For a new generation of students to contribute to development and utilization of agricultural biotechnology in ways that enhance FEW systems, they must be able to integrate knowledge and uncertainties from diverse, sophisticated fields of study; understand how facts and values influence decision-making; and establish their trustworthiness through evidence-based engagement with diverse communities. Tapping into North Carolina State's extension network, AgBioFEWS trainees will begin their programs living together in a small farming community situated in an ecologically fragile landscape. They will receive hands-on learning from farmers, extension agents, conservationists, and other public stakeholders in rural North Carolina. This experience is also designed to build team cohesiveness. Subsequent coursework and activities will expand student perspectives on agricultural biotechnology and FEW systems to national and international scales. AgBioFEWS course offerings will be integrated into an established graduate minor in Genetic Engineering and Society and an emerging minor in Public Science. The courses will address techniques of genetic engineering, agriculture, policy analysis, science communication, and other topics needed to prepare students for careers in government, industry, international development, and academia. All AgBioFEWS trainees will participate in an interdisciplinary team project under the direction of 2-3 faculty members, and doctoral trainees are expected to incorporate interdisciplinary agricultural biotechnology and FEW systems into their dissertations. Major research efforts range from investigating the impact of current biotechnology products on FEW socio-ecological systems to the development of potential future products.

Each of these interactions creates opportunities for modeling, driven by sensor-based and qualitative data collection, to improve the effectiveness of system operation and control in the short term as well as investments and planning for the long term. The large volume and complexity of the data collected creates challenges for decision support and stakeholder communication. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Iowa State University will build a community of researchers that explores, develops and implements effective data-driven decision-making to efficiently produce food, transform primary energy sources into energy carriers, and enhance water quality.  The project anticipates training forty-eight (48) MS and PhD students, including twenty-four (24) funded PhD trainees, from agricultural and biosystems engineering, agronomy, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering and natural resources ecology and management. The project aims to prepare trainees for multiple career paths such as research scientists, bioeconomy entrepreneurs, agribusiness leaders, policy makers, agriculture analytics specialists, or professors. 

Sustainable provision of food, energy and clean water requires understanding the interdependencies among systems as well as the motivations and incentives of farmers and rural policy makers. Effective innovation at the nexus of these food, energy and water (FEW) systems requires data-rich system modeling with analytic capabilities for diverse types of data. The traineeship has four key components. First, trainees will complete a new graduate certificate to build competencies in fundamental understanding of interactions among food production, water quality and bioenergy; data acquisition, visualization, and analytics; complex systems modeling for decision support; and the economics, policy and sociology of the FEW nexus.  Second, they will conduct interdisciplinary research on (a) technologies and practices to increase agriculture's contributions to energy supply while reducing its negative impacts on water quality and human health; (b) data science to increase crop productivity within the constraints of sustainable intensification; or (c) decision sciences to manage tradeoffs and promote best practices among diverse stakeholders. Third, they will participate in a new graduate learning community consisting of a two-year series of workshops that focus in alternate years on the context of the Midwest agricultural FEW nexus and professional development.

Currently, the demographic composition of the student body in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) doctoral programs and the scientific workforce is not only different from the composition of U.S. demographics, but it is also changing more slowly than the demographic shifts in the US. It is important to address these inequities in order to create a robust domestic scientific workforce, which may contribute to a healthy economy and promote U.S. scientific superiority. Inherited practices for recruiting, admitting, and mentoring graduate students contribute to these inequities, as does the lack of opportunity for faculty to reflect upon their practices in these areas. This award creates innovative systems by which faculty can improve those practices, and therefore holds significant promise as a strategy for broadening participation in graduate education and the scientific workforce. 

The project will form a network that provides faculty and graduate school administrators within and across the University of Southern California and University of California campuses at Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara with opportunity and incentives to critically reflect upon and change longstanding practices. Participating STEM PhD programs will receive professional development from project leaders in the form of workshops and continuous learning activities on recruiting, admitting, and mentoring graduate students from diverse backgrounds. Leaders that emerge from each program in years 1 and 2 will be selected to establish campus-level teams who will deliver similar faculty-to-faculty learning opportunities on their own campuses. The research and evaluation activities of the project involve a sequential multi-method study, including the first-ever clustered randomized experiment to test the impact of faculty development around three outcomes: the admissions practices that PhD programs use, the diversity of their admitted cohorts, and the programs' selectivity.

Currently, the demographic composition of the student body in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) doctoral programs and the scientific workforce is not only different from the composition of U.S. demographics, but it is also changing more slowly than the demographic shifts in the US. It is important to address these inequities in order to create a robust domestic scientific workforce, which may contribute to a healthy economy and promote U.S. scientific superiority. Inherited practices for recruiting, admitting, and mentoring graduate students contribute to these inequities, as does the lack of opportunity for faculty to reflect upon their practices in these areas. This award creates innovative systems by which faculty can improve those practices, and therefore holds significant promise as a strategy for broadening participation in graduate education and the scientific workforce. 

The project will form a network that provides faculty and graduate school administrators within and across the University of Southern California and University of California campuses at Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara with opportunity and incentives to critically reflect upon and change longstanding practices. Participating STEM PhD programs will receive professional development from project leaders in the form of workshops and continuous learning activities on recruiting, admitting, and mentoring graduate students from diverse backgrounds. Leaders that emerge from each program in years 1 and 2 will be selected to establish campus-level teams who will deliver similar faculty-to-faculty learning opportunities on their own campuses. The research and evaluation activities of the project involve a sequential multi-method study, including the first-ever clustered randomized experiment to test the impact of faculty development around three outcomes: the admissions practices that PhD programs use, the diversity of their admitted cohorts, and the programs' selectivity. The structure of the network allows for sustainable gains, and it works with, rather than against, the decentralized nature of graduate education and its varied institutional and disciplinary contexts.

The project is a collaboration between the Department of Mathematical Sciences (MathStat), the Montana multi-university Materials Science (MTSI) interdisciplinary doctoral program and business, industry and government (BIG) partners. MT PEAKS program activities consist of three main pillars: interdisciplinary research project activities involving a BIG-inspired project and MTSI lab rotations, an internship experience with a BIG partner, and preparatory coursework and professional development activities. MT PEAKS students will apply their mathematical and statistical skills in the context of a year-long research project developed through collaboration with an advisory team of MathStat and MTSI faculty and a BIG partner.  They will also participate in summer internships with BIG partners. The program will produce a broadly prepared workforce of PhD mathematicians and statisticians ready to apply their technical skills and multidisciplinary exposure to help address a myriad of regional, national and global challenges outside the traditional academic environment. This project is co-funded by the NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program, which is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.

Coordination of the lab rotations, the interdisciplinary research project, and the BIG internship is a hallmark of the MT PEAKS program. Lab rotations will expose MT PEAKS participants to a variety of sophisticated large and bench scale instrumentation, experimental protocols, lab safety practices, and team dynamics. MT PEAKS students will be trained by MTSI doctoral student mentors on the use of lab equipment needed for experimentation and data collection related to their lab projects. MTSI mentors will be chosen so that their research focus complements the MT PEAKS participant's lab project. The interdisciplinary research project will include a component that involves the collection and analysis of experimental data and technical information from a core group of MathStat and MTSI faculty and a BIG partner. BIG partners will provide students with internship experiences that foster growth in communication and teamwork skills, as well as an increase in students' recognition of the ubiquitous nature of mathematics and statistics in the modern technical workplace. Students will also participate in professional development workshops to enhance networking and other professional skill sets.  Results of graduate training aspects of MT PEAKS will be disseminated through online media and educational journals.

Yet the barriers to success these groups face are often not adequately addressed by traditional methods of mentoring and professionalization in science. Minority-serving institutions are uniquely poised to foster diverse science leaders, but they also require a systematic, integrated, program-wide approach geared toward nurturing and validating students' identities as scientists. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Texas San Antonio cultivates science identity by integrating holistic mentoring with systematic training in science writing and public science communication. This program will test an innovative and potentially transformative model for diversifying science that engages both faculty and graduate students from the department of Environmental Science and Ecology in a community-supported, holistic, and systematic approach. The project will utilize a series of graduate courses, professional workshops, and community-based activities that seek to foster and validate underrepresented minority students' science identity. Nationally, these interventions may exist informally, but they are rarely, if ever, fully integrated into a coherent graduate STEM program. Developing diverse leaders in science professions is crucial as scientists navigate interdisciplinary knowledge demands and cultural challenges in a globalized and media-saturated world. 

The goal of this IGE project is to cultivate a science identity for underrepresented minority graduate students through the acquisition of a knowledge base (competence), the ability to perform science practices (performance), and the acknowledgement by significant others in the field (recognition). The researchers propose that fostering these identity components and making them visible in scientific disciplines and public communities can be achieved through three interrelated interventions: holistic mentoring, writing-to-learn science, and public science communication. Holistic mentoring, both in and outside the classroom environment will provide the underlying framework necessary to address the needs and challenges faced by underrepresented minority students. In addition, this project hypothesizes that holistic mentoring transforms the challenges of systematic training in research-based science writing and public science communication into opportunities to validate students' scientific competence and leadership skills. The project will use a mixed-methods assessment approach to analyze not only each intervention but also on the relationships among all three interventions. Therefore, it seeks to provide an evidence-based validation of the impact of holistic mentoring and systematic communications training on cultivating a scientific ethos for underrepresented minority graduate students.

One particular challenge that has been noted focuses on career pathways.  Graduate students generally are not exposed to the breadth of career pathways that are open to Ph.D. recipients, thereby hampering students from making informed decisions about their educational paths and professional preparation.  Accurate and transparent program and career outcomes data are necessary to enable students to identify and direct their studies toward their desired career goals. This National Science Foundation award to the Association of American Universities (AAU) will support a workshop that will bring together representatives from a number of institutions currently engaged in efforts to document and make publicly available data on doctoral program admission, completion, and career outcome measures; scholars conducting research on doctoral career pathways; and university administrators charged with overseeing graduate education. The goal of the workshop is to survey the existing landscape for understanding doctoral education outcomes, foster synergies among participants, and determine next directions.

The one-and-a-half-day workshop will support discussions among participants regarding methodologies used in data collection, how collected data is intended or not intended to be used, and what efforts can be undertaken to increase communication across existing efforts, standardize approaches, and improve documentation and availability of data on doctoral education and career outcomes. Representatives from a number of major efforts to collect and analyze doctoral educational outcomes data, administrative leaders at doctoral-granting institutions, and leaders of efforts on broadening career pathways for students will be invited to participate. The workshop will include panel presentations and facilitated discussions. Access to reliable, accurate, and transparent data is an essential starting point for discussions that can lead to effective decision making. The immediate goal of this workshop is to determine direct steps that can make such data standardized and available to the community and stakeholders. Ultimately, the expectation is that this will lead to work that will identify and mitigate institutional, cultural, and disciplinary barriers that may prevent doctoral students from identifying, exploring, and preparing for a wide range of career pathways.

Scientific synthesis across disciplines is at the heart of addressing important challenges such as impacts of global change, trade-offs between water, food, and energy production, and the need for sustainable cities. Studies of interdisciplinary research teams indicate that team members struggle to achieve knowledge synthesis across disciplines. Issues arise due to the inability of team members to develop deep knowledge at the frontier of other disciplines and to connect that knowledge with their own expertise to provide a collaborative path forward. The ability to work collaboratively in a research team with others who may hold very different perspectives is a critical aspect of preparing today's students to meet future workforce demands. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) track is a collaborative project led by the University of Texas at El Paso involving graduate students and faculty from multiple institutions.  The project will test a new model for training graduate student teams in environmental sciences to overcome knowledge integration and synthesis challenges.

This model will draw on findings from cognitive, learning, and social sciences to develop and test training for graduate students and faculty in model-based reasoning approaches. Model-based reasoning theory posits that humans reason by constructing an internal mental model of the situations, events, and processes that they encounter, and that external representations can be used to facilitate construction of these mental models. External representations include the use of analogies, metaphor, visual models, diagrams and/or other representations for abstraction and communication of complex concepts. In a team setting, these external representations are called boundary negotiating objects.  This project will place doctoral students in multidisciplinary teams and facilitate a structured, participatory process that includes a progression of standard, individual and group model-based reasoning activities as well as instruction on the purposeful co-creation of boundary negotiating objects.  Students from multiple institutions will learn together through two-week summer experiences; students who are conducting research in conjunction with larger interdisciplinary teams will be targeted.  In addition, the project will train faculty from multiple institution in the model.  The project will examine the implementation of ten faculty members.  Survey, interview, and digital data will be collected to examine how graduate students respond to being directly exposed to theories behind the approach as well as the efficacy of the approach as faculty employ it in their graduate classes. This design will allow comparison of the outcomes from guiding students on what to do, versus teaching students why and how to do it.  

The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training.

The students will be brought through the program and trained in critical research and professional skills needed in the modern world of collaborative and interdisciplinary research. The year-long activities will be built around an intensive summer camp that kicks off the program for each student and ongoing web-based groups through which much of the skill-building and mentoring will take place. The effort is a partnership between the Mathematics and Climate Research Network (MCRN) and the American Institute of Mathematics (AIM).

For example, pathogens, pests, and invasive species often quickly evolve resistance to control measures, while important crops and wild populations have limited or variable capacity to adapt to rapidly changing global conditions.  Important insights into the mechanisms of pathogen/pest resistance and resilience will require collaborative efforts that apply evolutionary principles to big data analyses and visualization. However, few opportunities exist for trainees to develop the unique combination of relevant evolutionary, quantitative, and teamwork skills. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Vermont will meet this demand with an interdisciplinary PhD training program called QUantitative & Evolutionary STEM Training (QUEST). The project anticipates training 36 PhD students as core trainees, 18 of whom will receive NRT-funded stipends, from a range of disciplines including biology, mathematics and statistics, engineering, agricultural sciences, environmental studies, and health sciences. 
 
The QUEST program is unique in its emphasis on evolutionary training, modeling for prediction, and culturally sensitive teamwork. Major research efforts will focus on three areas: (i) emerging infectious diseases and modeling for prediction, (ii) rapid evolution in response to antibiotics, pesticides, and global change conditions, and (iii) pathogen interactions that affect food security and ecosystem health. A supportive and collaborative training environment will be cultivated by cohort building via a shared, physical space, a set of core courses in which trainees work in teams to solve real-world problems, and a seminar that includes invited speakers and professional development activities. In addition, QUEST trainees will complete an applied internship, selected from government, non-profit, industry, and international partners. Through cultural sensitivity and inclusion training for faculty, staff and trainees, and innovative recruitment efforts, the traineeship aims to increase underrepresented groups in STEM. Project outcomes will be (1) trainees that are experts in the application of deep evolutionary and quantitative knowledge to develop solutions for resilience in environmental and global health systems, (2) trainees that can work creatively and collaboratively to translate their skills to practical solutions in non-academic sectors, and (3) a scalable, transferable graduate training program that increases diversity in STEM fields.

Working in teams is challenging for many scientists and engineers because the culture of universities, where they studied, recognizes and rewards individual achievement. For example, a Ph.D. student's final project report, the dissertation, must represent the student's own original contribution. Likewise, universities promote individual faculty members, not groups, through the ranks. Despite the importance of team-based research, universities have historically provided little systematic preparation for science and engineering graduate students to help them succeed in careers involving greater collaboration. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the Georgia Institute of Technology will address these challenges by developing materials to train graduate students to work in teams and by measuring the effectiveness of these materials. The project will take a novel approach to curriculum development by drawing on best practices in team training from a wide range of sources such as the healthcare industry, aviation, and the military. Adaptation of these materials to meet the needs of graduate students will ensure that the students become effective team members and leaders who can advance science and engineering throughout their careers. 

This project seeks to determine how graduate students learn to be effective team members and team leaders. The project will investigate which instructional materials and approaches are most effective for students to develop teamwork competencies and which settings are most suitable for learning and retaining specific transportable skills. This project has three goals: (1) develop instructional materials and collaborative processes for team training; (2) implement these instructional materials; and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of instructional materials as well as the processes for developing and implementing team training at the graduate level. Achieving these goals will add to the knowledge base about effective graduate education. The project focuses on three key considerations: competencies, audiences, and settings. The competencies studied by this project are transportable, meaning they are useful in many different areas of research. Examples include knowledge about the nature and value of teamwork, skills in communication and conflict management, and attitudes about diversity and inclusiveness. The audience for the project includes M.S. and Ph.D. students across a wide range of STEM programs. To maximize flexibility, the team will develop curricular materials in small units that faculty can deliver in different settings. Settings where materials will be developed and introduced include existing academic courses, short (60-90 minute) or longer (half day, full day) workshops, and semester-long academic courses.

These data could represent, for example: DNA sequences, images of the brain, or number of species in an ecosystem. In each case, unlocking the information within these big data sets requires sophisticated mathematical and computational approaches. The standard curriculum for graduate students in biological sciences was designed well before this data deluge. As a consequence, today's graduate students are not being adequately trained for their future careers. At the same time, there are growing concerns that scientists are sometimes unable to reproduce published findings. This inability often results from poor data analysis strategies. The future success of the US biological research mission hinges on training students to use data analysis approaches that are both rigorous and reproducible. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Chicago seeks to meet this need by developing a new and effective approach to the training of early stage graduate students in the quantitative analysis of biological data.

The overarching goal of this program is to teach students to critically evaluate quantitative analysis methods in the scientific literature, and to acquire good programming habits that support reproducibility and rigor in their own research. An interdisciplinary team of quantitative biologists will direct and lead the program, exposing students to the faculty that can advise them in future work. The training program begins with an intensive residential week-long boot camp that brings together students across diverse sub-fields of biology to promote teamwork and prepare them for interdisciplinary research. The boot camp includes introductory tutorials in computer programming, statistics, and modeling in modern biology, as well as more advanced tutorials in statistical approaches to large data sets and practical lessons in organizing and sharing code and data. The boot camp is capped off with a series of workshops in which students apply what they have learned to real biological data spanning a wide range of fields. A subsequent on-campus course builds on and reviews these concepts, and integrates training in rigor and reproducibility with concepts of responsible research. We hypothesize that this program will produce trainees who are well-prepared for the future scientific workforce. We will evaluate the impact of this intervention through quizzes, surveys, and targeted interviews. All teaching materials and data sets used in the workshops will be shared online so that any university can implement a similar training module on their own campus.

A grand challenge for society is to improve the scientific understanding of natural and human impacts on marine ecosystems to ensure that the oceans continue to provide for generations to come. To overcome this challenge, a segment of our nation's workforce must address an unmet and growing demand for hypothesis-driven research to inform the decisions of federal and state resource management agencies. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of California, Davis will train the next generation of marine scientists under a new paradigm that puts the policy focus on the front-end of the research and training enterprise as a means of building more effective links between the science and decisions on sustainable use of living marine resources. The project anticipates training 60 PhD students, including 30 funded trainees, from ecology, conservation biology, economics, geology, physiology, biogeochemistry, and oceanography. 

There is growing appreciation that the disconnect between the scientific and policy communities is due to the scientific research questions not aligning with the information that policymakers need to make informed decisions, and to the researchers rarely having the wide-angle lens necessary to understand how their disciplinary research integrates with other science to address policy questions. The basis for the training program's paradigm is a novel causal chain model that extends from a policy goal to the different types of scientific information needed to measure the impacts of management decisions. The practice of working through a causal chain, coupled with fieldtrips to stakeholders, basecamps (week-long workshops with decision-makers and stakeholders organized around marine management issues), internships, short-term visiting scientists, research symposium, data-model integration training, and immersion in marine science and policy will provide trainees with a deeper understanding of how their own STEM research, founded in the primary perspective of a single discipline, fits into a policy process. Trainees will be recruited from a diversity of populations, with special attention to students from natural resource-dependent communities (e.g., tribal nations in Northern California, rural and remote coastal towns). Recruitment, mentoring, and professional development skills are woven throughout all of the elements of the training program, including research partnerships with tribal nations and direct engagement with resource-dependent communities via the fieldtrips and basecamps. Elements of the training program are also open to California State University (CSU) masters students through our novel Scholars Program in partnership with CSU's Council on Ocean Affairs and Technology (COAST) program.

In particular, continuing development is necessarily accompanied by rising demand for food, energy, and water. Advancing the understanding of these complex and interacting systems requires training a next generation of interdisciplinary scientists with the computational skills required to exploit growing torrents of relevant data. This National Science Foundation Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Chicago will produce students who are fully grounded in their respective disciplines and who have the computational skills and breadth of knowledge needed to address and communicate the food-energy-water system in all of its complexity. This project anticipates providing training for thirty (30) MS and PhD students, including fifteen (15) funded trainees, from across the physical, biological, and social sciences, uniting them with a common focus on computation and data analysis. The project's vision is to create a new model for interdisciplinary training that gives students the ability to collaborate and work across fields and to apply cutting-edge computational methods. 

The trainees' educational program is structured to generate a cohesive community of young researchers who have regular, in-depth interactions and opportunities to share expertise across disciplines. Program components include: (1) two-week bootcamps prior to the start of each Fall quarter that provide skills training and introduce cross-disciplinary material, including modules on computing, data analysis, and statistics; (2) a year-long core course sequence consisting of an introduction to the food-energy-water system followed by a data analysis practicum in which students work in interdisciplinary teams to analyze datasets; (3) communication and professional development training; (4) international experience opportunities; and (5) community building activities. All educational elements will be opened to students across the University of Chicago whenever possible. An important goal of the program is to improve the recruitment and retention of graduate students from underrepresented groups. Finally, to enable dissemination of the educational model to other institutions, the project will quantitatively evaluate the benefits of the education program and publicly disseminate all educational material to facilitate its use.

But the fields of Science and Engineering have a diversity problem which inhibits a vibrant, creative, and diverse talent pool. Many higher education programs have responded to this issue by creating programs intended to narrow the diversity gap in STEM fields. While these efforts have begun to bridge the gap for some underrepresented minority populations, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) remain the least represented group of students in graduate degrees in STEM fields. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Arizona (UA) will improve persistence of AI/AN engineering students and impact faculty perceptions and attitudes through the inclusion of indigenous and more conversational methods of interaction. This project addresses the issue of low numbers of AI/AN science and engineering practitioners by implementing and investigating several culturally relevant program components designed to impact the relationships among AI/AN students, faculty mentors, and Tribal Nation leaders. The novelty of this pilot project is in the systematic implementation and assessment of program modules, grounded in education science and social theories that are hypothesized to dramatically improve persistence of AI/AN in STEM graduate programs, especially in engineering. 

This program will transform the graduate education experience for indigenous engineering students and university engineering faculty. The approach acknowledges and leverages the cultural and social capital present in the AI/AN students at UA, and is framed in research on critical race theories and family education models. UA has a unique opportunity to work with the 22 federally recognized tribes that lie within the state of Arizona. These nations occupy over one quarter of Arizona, and are the home to over 250,000 American Indians. This UA-based IGE testbed uses ethnographic methods to study the meaning of actions and events surrounding the concepts of engagement, belongingness, and other components critical to persistence in graduate school study from the perspective of AI/AN students, faculty mentors and Tribal Nation leaders. The model contains four major components that reflect a holistic, empirically-based, systems approach to the successful persistence of AI/AN graduate students: 1) Financial Assistance: partnering with the SLOAN scholarship program at UA for tuition funding for indigenous engineering students; 2) Community-driven research: relationship building with local tribal partners; 3) Indigenous Faculty Mentoring: Indigenous Mentoring Program as part of a faculty training initiative; and 4) providing student integration and professional skills development to increase a sense of belongingness and professional engineering preparation. These four components are individually critical, collectively powerful, and provide an empowering, positive, and persistent graduate academic career for AI/AN students from all tribes and Native communities. Successful elements of the testbed will be scaled to other regions nationwide.

This broad graduate training will help develop a workforce and agricultural industry better capable of managing future demands on food, energy, and water systems. 

This NRT program will focus on understanding aspects of resilience in water-stressed and energy-demanding agricultural landscapes and will utilize resilience and panarchy theory, adaptive management, novel sensing technologies and modeling, and policy interventions. Such interdisciplinary training is rare in graduate programs in the United States, but is vital to prepare the next generation of natural resource scientists, producers, managers, engineers, and policymakers so they may respond to the challenges created by increasing demands for diminishing and interconnected resources, and the need to maintain and build resilience in stressed watersheds. This NRT program will serve as the innovative foundation for a permanent interdisciplinary graduate program in the resilience of agro-ecosystems. The program will ensure that students, academic programs, government agencies, and the private sector engage in building and preserving natural and agricultural ecosystems to meet local and global demands for water, clean energy, food, and ecosystem services. Graduate student research will focus on the complex and intertwined ecological, technical, and societal systems involved in managing resources in the 21st century, particularly in complex landscapes managed for agricultural production. Further, the program will help develop innovative tools for data collection, analysis, and synthesis to support management and restoration decisions in agricultural systems.

Graduate training, however, typically occurs in one of two dimensions: experimental and observational methods in a specific area such as biology and sociology, or in general methodologies such as machine learning and data science.  With more and more students seeking to gain sufficient expertise in mathematical and computational methods on top of domain-specific laboratory and social analysis methodologies, a greater demand for more efficient training is emerging. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Indiana University will address this growing need with an integrated dual PhD program that trains students to be ""bidisciplinary"" in Complex Networks and Systems (CNS) and another discipline of their choosing from the natural and social sciences. It will seamlessly integrate traditional education with interdisciplinary hands-on research in a culture of academic and human diversity. This program will provide unique interdisciplinary training for thirty-four (34) PhD students, including twenty-two (22) funded trainees. The program will provide additional training experience to 40 summer affiliate students and a population of more than 300 participants across the participating PhD programs.

The training program capitalizes on the new Indiana University Network Science Institute (IUNI). The Institute's 165+ faculty members will serve in interdisciplinary PhD program committees to be co-chaired by research mentors from both CNS and the target empirical domain. Project-driven, team-based research at IUNI will seamlessly integrate academic education with interdisciplinary hands-on scientific and industrial research. Trainees will learn to connect the general-purpose, computational expertise of CNS to the deep, domain-specific research methodologies of the natural, behavioral, and social sciences thus bridging the gap between distinct training cultures. They will be a new breed of STEM scientists that escapes the silos of disciplinary training to address the complex problems of the 21st century. Specifically, the four goals of training activity are: 1) provide dual research proficiency; 2) develop collaborative skills via early integration into problem-driven, interdisciplinary research; 3) produce a diverse workforce by recruiting student cohorts from a broad set of disciplines and varied backgrounds to be trained within a team culture; 4) establish a sustainable interdisciplinary training model by enlarging the institutional channels created between informatics and natural and social sciences to other Indiana University departments and institutions. A science-of-science study conducted throughout the NRT project will evaluate the efficacy of interdisciplinary training of the students in this program. This project will develop a flexible dual PhD program and best-practices to allow additional departments at Indiana University to join the program in the future, as well as other institutions to develop similar programs.

At present, six out of ten people live near the coast and are susceptible to hurricanes, tsunamis, and other hazards. Coastal and other hazards also threaten economic and geopolitical stability, and national security. Hurricanes Sandy (2012) and Katrina (2005) and the Tohoku tsunami (2011) and Typhoon Haiyan (2013) are reminders of the immense long-term impacts such hazards pose. Despite the accelerating risk of such events, resource allocations and coping strategies are often complicated and by varying stakeholder interests. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Virginia Tech will synthesize expertise in science, engineering, planning, and business to address the critical issue of growing disaster losses attributed to both natural and man made hazards. The program will train a new community of multi-disciplinary researchers, practitioners, and leaders at the master's and doctoral levels. Over five years, the project will support 26 trainees on NSF stipends, and an estimated 150 additional students will participate in at least one element of the program. Each trainee will pursue a degree through existing academic entities at Virginia Tech or through the university's new Individualized Interdisciplinary PhD program. 

The project will develop new transdisciplinary approaches critical for advancing knowledge and understanding of disaster-resilience and risk management across different STEM and non-STEM disciplines. The involved faculty are not only experts in their own disciplines, but also have a shared history of transdisciplinary disaster-resilience and risk management research and education. Trainees will work with faculty and each other to develop innovative, comprehensive, inclusive, and sustainable methods and practices that seek to mitigate disasters emanating from natural and manmade hazards. Trainees will also learn about and lead stakeholder engagement exercises that explore how people and institutions respond to disasters and risk. Integration of student research with stakeholder interaction and engagement provides a novel and potentially transformative educational component that could be replicated in other transdisciplinary graduate programs. Intentional training in the societal context in which disasters unfold has the potential to deepen communications among disaster-resilience and risk management professionals and researchers and the communities they serve. Educational innovations include i) integrating research and education through a unique approach to stakeholder engagement, ii) emphasizing intentional development of transdisciplinary thinking, and iii) integrating faculty and graduate students into a community of practice that fosters diversity and inclusion. The result will be diverse, globally competitive scholars who understand the fundamental aspects of disaster resilience and its broader implications outside traditional STEM fields.

It is a global issue that affects a significant number of individuals domestically. To address it, humanitarian organizations involved in hunger relief work collaboratively with the government and private sector. Humanitarian organizations rely on uncertain sources of supply, respond to uneven and variable needs, and make careful decisions regarding how to use scarce resources. These organizations generate data on a massive scale about food supply, food distribution, and food need, which helps them to perform their function. Challenges arise from not only the uncertainty of supply and demand but also from variations in information collected by different organizations. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University will develop an innovative, interdisciplinary training model in data science designed to grow the workforce that will help these organizations analyze their efforts and improve the provision of food aid at the local, state, and federal level. This traineeship seeks to provide a unique and comprehensive training experience for a total of 50 masters and doctoral students, including forty-five (45) funded trainees, by combining disciplines in industrial and systems engineering, computer science, mathematics, agricultural economics, sociology, and public policy.

At present, no formal training mechanism exists by which students can acquire the interdisciplinary knowledge needed to derive insight from heterogeneous big data generated by the food aid supply chain because (a) traditional STEM student training in this area does not include the public policy perspective and (b) working with big data is limited to a subset of the STEM population. To answer this need, this project's research and education efforts will use existing data from the domestic humanitarian hunger relief supply chain as the basis for an innovative, evidence-based, scalable approach to training its future workforce. Our program will provide a model for preparing the next generation of data scientists employed in the humanitarian sector. The overarching goal is two-fold: (i) to create a sustainable training model that improves the preparation of students in STEM fields to pursue careers in data science and (ii) to provide training experiences that will orient students on the use of big data to inform and potentially transform the delivery of services that have societal impact. We propose to leverage big data to reduce uncertainty in this supply chain and drive more effective modes of food distribution by addressing information inequality, visualization, and information-driven decision modeling. The program will feature a summer training institute, industry/academia research clusters, professional development seminars, and ongoing evaluation of the training model. Students who complete all requirements will obtain new knowledge and skills with respect to big data collection, interpretation, and its use in decision-making; obtain new knowledge about using big data to address multidisciplinary problems in hunger relief and food security; and obtain the training necessary to pass an industry-level certification exam. At North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, the award will help to establish a new certificate-based interdisciplinary graduate training program in data science. In the larger humanitarian sector, the research generated by this work will improve access to food by reducing information inequality, enhance operational decision-making by providing real-time adaptable visualization of information, and create new information-driven decision models that can positively impact food aid policy and operations.

Persistence within career paths will be increased, and the numbers of women in leadership roles nationally will be enhanced. A team comprising scientists and engineers, academic and industry leaders, case studies teaching experts, and evaluation and educational researchers will design and implement the program. 

The NAVIGATE program employs a proven pedagogy from business, law, and medicine, the Case Study Teaching Method, which has been shown to promote internalization of learning and the development of analytical, problem-solving and decision-making skills, to empower women STEM graduate students to recognize and combat gender bias, inequity and discrimination. The program is informed by current theories of equity, diversity and inclusion, and by literature on the issues women STEM professionals encounter in the workforce. This project will test, for the first time, the effectiveness of the Case Study Method for developing students' skills to navigate these issues. The project team will use a mixed methods research design to collect qualitative and quantitative data to evaluate the effectiveness of the graduate training program.

The team working on this project includes domain experts in physics, biology, mathematics, and engineering, as well as experts in public speaking, acting, education research, and library sciences. This broad expertise will ensure that disciplinarily diverse STEM students are recruited into the program, providing interdisciplinary perspectives and instruction and facilitating the success of this pilot graduate training program. 

This research will investigate whether targeted intervention in oral communication skills for STEM graduate students improves their ability to effectively convey their research to a broad audience. The project will use formative, summative, and longitudinal assessments to determine how various portions of the intervention are successful in developing students' oral communication skills in the following realms: avoiding the use of jargon, public speaking skills, and non-verbal delivery skills. Assessment data for year-long longitudinal studies of each cohort will include survey data related to three areas of oral communication, self-reports from students, and interviews with students and their mentors. To assess competencies such as reducing jargon for communicating with the public, this project will create, modify and use rubrics for effective public speaking.

However, achieving such integration through collaborative team science (research conducted by more than one discipline in an interdependent manner) has proven elusive due in large part to deficiencies in key professional, teamwork, and leadership skills among the team members. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the College of William & Mary's (W&M) Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) seeks to address these deficiencies by designing and testing team science professional development training for coastal ocean and estuarine STEM graduate students. The project will be implemented through the Virginia Sea Grant College, which is composed of VIMS/W&M, the University of Virginia, Virginia Tech, and George Mason, James Madison, Old Dominion, and Virginia Commonwealth Universities.

The project assembles a multi-disciplinary team of faculty facilitators to guide a class of diverse doctoral and master's students from the natural and physical coastal, marine and environmental sciences, engineering, design, and social and economic sciences. An innovative workshop series trains students in the principles of team science, collaborative leadership, and effective self-reflective tools and strategies to improve teamwork. Working closely with coastal community partners (e.g., municipalities, NGOs), this community-based climate-resilience project enables students to practice team science research and use reflective practices to improve their competencies in teamwork. Assessment of the reflective practices (using team reflexivity, Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness, and expertise coordination measures) will improve understanding of how to nurture self-reflective competencies in the short-term and build capacity for team science research that will enhance students' careers over the long term. The lesson plans, training modules, and implementation strategies will be compiled into an online toolkit and shared broadly through professional societies of graduate school deans, multiple conference presentations, and workshops, and extended through alumni networks at the participating institutions for peer mentoring and executive coaching. Further, collaboration with the Virginia Council of Graduate Schools will help to enhance recruitment of diverse participants, reinforce learning with workshop alumni, promote global dissemination, and institutionalize benefits into existing courses and degree programs.

However, many of the positive changes to instructional practices and metrics for success have not been implemented at the graduate level. With a national economy increasingly dependent on highly-trained specialists in technical fields, this is a nationally-relevant problem. Similarly widespread are the problems of high attrition rates in physics graduate programs (on the order of 50%, nationally) and persistent underrepresentation of women, African Americans, Hispanics and other groups in Physics and STEM. These chronic shortcomings in diversity and in retention highlight the need for improved strategies in STEM education at the graduate level. One of the significant barriers identified is the traditionally-taught graduate core physics courses.  This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) Track to The Ohio State University will seek to develop, adopt, and assess innovative, research-based instructional best practices in graduate-level physics courses, especially focusing on factors affecting retention and diversity. In particular, the project is aimed at ensuring that the developed methods and materials are widely-applicable and adoptable by engaging multiple sites in the development process (initially four large Midwestern research universities), and collecting data on effectiveness at each site.

 A critical strategy of the project is to directly engage the graduate core course instructors of each participating institution. The approach applies and adapts a successful model for establishing and maintaining faculty learning communities to facilitate the professional development of instructors and the adoption of research-based instructional materials and methods. The project will also engage the department graduate studies committees to facilitate positive change in policies and practices in order to ensure systemic and lasting change. In a bottom-up process emerging from the needs of the faculty learning communities, instructional materials will be developed via a highly effective research-based iterative model including the identification of student difficulties and construction of materials to engage students in addressing those difficulties in an inclusive and welcoming environment. The approach includes feedback to the instructors and the project researchers via performance on content tests, course assignments, in-class performance, student surveys (e.g., attitude, belonging, motivation) and student and faculty surveys and interviews. This program will advance our knowledge of topic-specific instructional materials and methods to improve student learning at the graduate level, which is currently virtually non-existent, and can serve as a model for other STEM graduate programs.

This alliance was created in response to the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 16-552) The AGEP program seeks to advance knowledge about models to improve pathways to the professoriate and success of historically underrepresented minority (URM) graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty in specific STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields.  AGEP Transformation Alliances develop, replicate or reproduce; implement and study, via integrated educational and social science research, models to transform the dissertator phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement, and the transitions within and across the pathway levels, of URMs in STEM and/or STEM education research careers. This Alliance is also funded by the NSF Research Traineeship Program (NRT) and the NSF's Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP). 

As the nation addresses a STEM achievement gap between URM and non-URM undergraduate and graduate students, our universities and colleges struggle to recruit, retain and promote URM STEM faculty who serve as role models and academic leaders for URM students to learn from, work with and emulate. Recent NSF reports indicate that URM STEM associate and full professors occupy 8% of these senior faculty positions at all 4-year colleges and universities and about 6% of these positions at the nation's most research-intensive institutions. The Texas A&M System AGEP Alliance has potential to advance a model to improve the success of URM graduate students and post-doctoral scholars as they enter and advance in the STEM professoriate.

The Texas A&M System AGEP Alliance is developing, implementing and studying a new model for advancing dissertating STEM doctoral candidates as they complete their doctorates, enter postdoctoral fellowships, and succeed in faculty positions.  Participants include women and men who are either African American, Hispanic American or Native American and who are majoring in the fields of Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Marine Biology, and Wildlife Science. The model development, implementation and testing, focuses on a unique set of interventions, including using individualized development plans for participants as they transition from dissertator to postdoctoral scholar to faculty; providing participants with professional development opportunities related to communication, writing, networking and job preparation/transition; supporting participants with mentors at the institutional and field-specific expert levels; and offering participants opportunities to experience academic culture and activities at historically black colleges and universities. The integrated research will address the effects of stigmatization on male and female adults who are non-STEM and STEM African Americans and Hispanic Americans.  The formative and summative evaluation is being conducted by Drs. Erin Burr and Kimberle Kelly, from the Oak Ridge Associated Universities. There is an external advisory committee which will provide feedback to the team on the effectiveness and outcomes of the project, as well as a separate external advisory group for the integrated research studies."

Such systems are appropriate in many remote regions of the world. By partnering with Diné College and Navajo Technical University, the project will directly engage underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Trainees will major in traditional disciplines while completing the program, which consists of internships, a FEWS-themed minor, professional development, and immersion in indigenous communities. Trainees will participate in the design and construction of pilot-scale capstone projects in dispersed water purification and greenhouse system design in underserved areas of the Navajo Nation. The projects will produce learning models for FEWS infrastructure development in areas that cannot be served from central facilities. The traineeship will provide stipends for 12 MS and 14 PhD students from several related science and engineering disciplines. Eleven students not funded by NSF will complete the program (6 MS and 5 PhD). It is anticipated that an additional 40 students will complete the FEWS minor and about 400 students will be impacted through participation in enriched courses cross-listed in multiple departments. 

The traineeship centers on the development of novel, sustainable solutions for off-grid production of safe drinking water and controlled environment agriculture systems. Research will focus on innovative photovoltaics, holographics, sensors and controls, desalination of brackish water, brine treatment and disposal, and materials and systems resiliency. Food-energy-water systems will be integrated with cultural norms, working collaboratively with indigenous communities using a coupled natural human systems approach to design/build culturally acceptable technology. The research program will employ (1) the use of semi-transparent organic photovoltaic materials sheets as greenhouse cover to provide light of sufficient intensity and quality to achieve substantial, high-quality crop yields while powering off-grid controlled environment agriculture systems, and (2) solar-driven nanofiltration devices operated with algal bioreactors to produce potable and irrigation water using a treatment strategy tailored to the use of the water. In both areas, the program will draw on indigenous knowledge of land and water practices to make these technical innovations acceptable for widespread public use.

The traditional career pathway for PhD students in the sciences, leading to a faculty job, is no longer reliable. Numerous recent reports have called on universities to provide better career development and preparation to help these highly-trained scientists and engineers go on to productive and satisfying careers in a broader range of job sectors. To create the necessary culture change and provide these resources, institutions need cost-effective, easily adaptable models that can transform from the bottom up. The PhD Career Ladder Program is a student-led career mentoring program that takes students through an eight-step curriculum of self-assessment, career exploration and preparation for a job search. Because the program is grassroots and peer-to-peer, it creates a supportive space for exploration of career paths inside and outside of academia and encourages persistence toward students' career goals. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to Stony Brook University will focus on expanding, improving and institutionalizing the PhD Career Ladder Program, and testing its effectiveness as a career development tool.

This award will allow Stony Brook to expand the existing PhD Career Ladder Program (PCLP) to new cohorts and develop standardized training for new peer leaders. The success of PCLP will be assessed through evaluation of its impact on participants as well as the effectiveness of its programmatic elements. Key measures include increasing student career knowledge and skills, enhancing students' confidence in their career prospects, transferable skills and job-search skills, broadening students? career horizons to include the pursuit of careers beyond academia, and cultivating a pipeline of new student leaders. The assessment also will measure research-grounded psychosocial variables such as shifts in scientific identity and perceived identity compatibility with diverse career pathways. The program, including the new train-the-trainers component and the expansion of PCLP to new student cohorts, will be assessed formatively throughout the project as well as summatively at the end of the project. Finally, findings on this highly adaptable and cost-effective model will be disseminated broadly, through an online clearinghouse of archived material and a program implementation toolkit.

Over several decades, diverse fields including genetics, neuroscience, linguistics, education, and psychology have generated a wealth of knowledge about myriad aspects of how humans learn, but a grand challenge remains: to integrate that knowledge into a unified understanding of learning based on these diverse fields, and on scales ranging from the gene to the neuron, brain, and human behavior. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Connecticut will help prepare the next generation of researchers to meet this challenge. The traineeship, focusing on the science of learning, will train fifty (50) PhD students, including twenty-five (25) funded trainees, from education, genetics, linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and speech-language-hearing sciences. By emphasizing a problem-based approach (learning by doing), embracing collaboration across a broad a spectrum of disciplines, and integrating hands-on training in communication and leadership skills that enable effective multidisciplinary project design, management, and scientific discovery, this program will offer trainees unique preparation for a range of careers in academia, industry, and the public sector. 

The training program has five major components: an intensive one-year seminar that surveys the science of learning across all participating fields, a hands-on practicum where trainees learn to design and implement multidisciplinary research, faculty-student research interest groups that serve as brainstorming launch pads for new scientific challenges, data stewardship modules, and integrated training in outreach and communication. The seminar provides a cross-disciplinary introduction to the science of learning and the challenge of technical communication, while the practicum emphasizes practical skills crucial in academic and nonacademic careers that graduate education too often lacks: project design and management, budgeting and resource allocation, and external communications. The research interest groups, which will evolve as promising research proposals emerge from the practicum, serve as both focal point for research and organizational structure for the participants. From their first day in the program, students face the challenge of how to clearly and effectively share ideas without assuming prior knowledge or relying on technical jargon, a skill that not only enables excellence in research, but empowers trainees to become ambassadors for their work to society as a whole. This program will also promote diversity in careers requiring advanced training through best practices in recruitment and retention.

The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs."

Further amplifying coastal flood risk, intense hurricanes may become more frequent in a warming world; while frequent heat, humidity and precipitation extremes provide additional stresses to societies, economies, and ecosystems. Yet traditional, disciplinary programs are poorly configured to train the workforce needed to assess coastal climate risk and to develop and deploy integrated strategies for increasing coastal climate resilience. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Rutgers University will prepare the workforce that will build coastal resilience in the face of climate risks, by training individuals at the MS and PhD levels who conduct research that integrates all the elements of coastal systems and that communicate effectively with coastal stakeholders in defining research problems, conducting research, and applying research to address real-world resilience challenges. The project anticipates training approximately one hundred (100) MS and PhD students, including twenty (20) funded trainees, from the Earth system sciences, social sciences, and engineering.

In preparation for developing and addressing transdisciplinary research questions related to coastal climate risk and resilience, as well as applying the knowledge gleaned through this research to developing resilient coastal systems, trainees will learn to: (1) serve as disciplinary experts in interdisciplinary teams; (2) formulate and investigate research questions and concept/systems models that integrate natural science, social science and engineering perspectives; (3) incorporate stakeholder needs into the construction of research questions and models and engage stakeholders in knowledge co-production; and (4) communicate with stakeholders about coastal climate risk and resilience. Over their first two years, trainees will take four core courses: (1) a methods and perspectives course; (2) a course on communicating science to decision-makers; (3) a summer field course, and (4) a studio workshop that brings trainees together with coastal stakeholders to address real decision problems. Faculty will work with trainees to incorporate transdisciplinary research into their theses and to track and reflect on their experiences through the use of mental mapping techniques.

The last five decades have seen a sharp increase in the frequency and impact of natural hazards and a significantly higher risk of man-made disasters, particularly since 9/11. Predicting and mitigating such extreme events is difficult due to interactions among infrastructure systems with complex, poorly understood feedback loops. Society needs professionals who can conceptualize complex systems where physical, cyber, and human infrastructure systems converge and who can transform this conceptual understanding into reliable computational models that are validated by data. Moreover, these professionals must be equipped with skills to effectively communicate with their peers in other disciplines and with decision and policy makers to ensure cohesion between science and policy. This NRT award will address these challenges through curriculum development, transformation in graduate education, and research with societal impact. The project anticipates training fifty-two (52) MS and PhD students, including twenty-six (26) funded trainees, from a variety of science and engineering disciplines related to model- and data-enabled infrastructure resiliency. 

This project envisions a new paradigm of graduate education conducive to training STEM professionals who are transdisciplinary system thinkers capable of crossing disciplinary boundaries and working in a dynamic network of continuously learning individuals and evolving knowledge. It represents a transformation in graduate education through the creation of collaborative research communities with strong peer-learning aspects, resulting in a local scientific community that enables students to learn the ?business? of science (networking, collaboration, communication, etc.). The NRT award will promote an agile, adaptive curriculum structure responsive to the changing needs of students through the development of a modular, personalized training program. It will enhance students? ability to apply academic research to complex, real-world problems with an awareness of societal impacts via a uniquely integrated research, training, and outreach program that studies infrastructure vulnerabilities that disproportionately affect low-income regions. Developed within a logic framework and with a thorough, research-driven evaluation plan, this training program will be reproducible on a larger scale. Student and faculty teams will conduct research in three core model engineering and data science areas: (1) integrating models to models, (2) incorporating data into models, and (3) communicating model predictions to decision makers. Their work in each of these areas will allow them to highlight key model/data science issues, understand how these issues translate to societal impacts caused by vulnerabilities in infrastructure systems, and develop solutions to mitigate damage caused by potential infrastructure vulnerabilities. The research on infrastructure resiliency will result in new approaches for modeling and analyzing coupled systems, enabling scientists and decision makers to come together to better understand interdependent infrastructure systems and their uncertainties.

Evaluation data from this project will allow the design of training materials to help faculty use more inclusive practices.  Because these interventions are likely to be transferrable to different fields and institutions, the project has the potential to revolutionize how STEM graduate admission is carried out and to increase the completion rates of US citizens in STEM PhD programs.

This project will address graduate STEM education inclusion at both the admission and retention phases. To address access, the project will investigate faculty attitudes and admission measures.  Physics faculty attitudes toward diversity, merit, and non-cognitive constructs will be assessed as a measure of change readiness.  Participating faculty will then be trained in holistic admissions, a method that is proven to increase diversity in graduate education. The project will develop and validate a non-cognitive assessment tool as part of the holistic admissions packet.  To address retention, faculty will be trained on evidence-based support structures that can help new graduate students manage the difficult first years of graduate school.  Experimental faculty-centered workshops on admissions and retention will be developed and delivered by the project to four partnering programs at three universities (Rochester Institute of Technology, University of Central Florida, and University of Denver) and then at national meetings hosted by the APS. Formative assessments of these workshops throughout the grant period will be used to revise and refine the materials, resulting in an Admissions and Retention Faculty Training Program that may be used by departments across the country.

Poor communities often face extreme challenges accessing nutritious food, clean and reliable energy, and safe water, which will be amplified with additional climate variability, population growth, stress on infrastructures, and pollution in the future. Through collaborative and immersive interdisciplinary training, graduate students will develop novel and lasting interdisciplinary approaches and technologies for solving FEWS challenges and reducing poverty with positive global impact. The program will engage over 400 students with up to 80 trainees, including 32 funded trainees, from engineering, social sciences, environmental sciences, business, and beyond. This effort enhances US leadership in basic research, human capacity building, and technical development to meet energy, water, and food access needs worldwide with positive environmental and economic sustainability benefits.

The research theme of this program addresses grand challenges in the design, implementation and coordination of food, energy and water systems within spatial and temporal constraints. Trainees will research topics such as capturing and reusing nutrients and water in organic waste products, development of small-scale water and energy technologies necessary for the agricultural sector and developing infrastructures and lifecycle methodologies to collect integrated information and data on food, energy, and water systems. Integrating human-centered design, innovative business models, and technological advancements with an interdisciplinary framework of development and continual impact analysis, this program provides cross-cultural learning, prototyping and scaling, and new models for productive multi-stakeholder collaboration. The model for STEM graduate education is one that emphasizes immersive interdisciplinary training, featuring team-taught courses that pair faculty in a technology discipline with one in business/social sciences using hands-on project-based learning approaches.

To fully realize these benefits will require a workforce with the technical skills to extract useful information from massive scientific data sets, calling for new approaches to graduate student training that emphasize expertise in data-driven science. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of California Irvine (UCI) will tackle this challenge by creating a training ecosystem comprised of leading UCI, national-laboratory, and private-sector researchers across particle physics, earth science, chemistry, statistics and machine learning; all bound together by expertise in the emerging Science of Team Science. The project anticipates training over sixty (60) MS and PhD students, including twenty (20) funded trainees, from diverse backgrounds in computational statistics, machine learning, earth science, particle physics, synthetic chemistry, and team science. After graduation, students from this program will have both the technical and team-science skills to be leaders in the emerging field of data-driven science, and to participate in and lead interdisciplinary research teams at national laboratories, in academia, and in industry labs.

The research agenda of the program seeks to create the foundation from which bridges can be built between the traditional scientific route of building interpretable models based on physical principles and data-driven modeling approaches that can provide high fidelity predictions but may lack clear interpretability in terms of the underlying science. The program will involve a number of interrelated research themes across multiple disciplines in the information and physical sciences, including machine learning (e.g. temporal and spatial data modeling, multi-scale models, deep learning, and scalable learning algorithms), particle and astroparticle physics (e.g. accelerator based experiments), earth systems science (e.g. reducing ecosystem response prediction uncertainties), and chemistry (e.g. prediction of physical properties of small molecules). A significant aspect of the program is an emphasis on team science as a core theme. Students will collaborate in small interdisciplinary research teams consisting of students and faculty with different disciplinary skills, and will take part in team-science workshops leading to student-led development of a team-science certificate in years 3 to 5 of the program. Summer internships for student participants, at both national and industry research laboratories, will serve to reinforce the students' academic training via participation in large-scale interdisciplinary data science research projects.

Interdependencies among variables abound, and their relationships can change over time in intricate, nonlinear ways.  Such complexities are common in nature and intelligent systems have evolved in biological organisms to adapt to these interdependencies and nonlinearities.  More recently, engineers have begun to build intelligent systems for applications in health, security, and industry that can similarly adapt.  The scientists who study intelligent adaptive systems in nature, as well as the engineers who build them in the lab, are increasingly in need of conceptual and technical abilities to deal with large, complex systems and datasets.  These abilities provide a common basis for exchanging hypotheses and theories among mathematicians, physicists, biologists, cognitive scientists, computer scientists and engineers; all of whom work on common problems of adaptation, learning, regulation, and prediction. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of California, Merced, will help the next generation of PhD students make interdisciplinary breakthroughs in theories and applications of intelligent adaptive systems. The project anticipates training 100 PhD students, including 50 funded trainees, from doctoral programs in applied mathematics, cognitive and information sciences, electrical engineering and computer science, mechanical engineering, physics, and quantitative and systems biology. 

Prior research in cybernetics, connectionism, and complex adaptive systems focused on general principles of intelligent adaptive systems that cut across disciplines and domains. The NRT program will advance the next wave of research in this area, by delving more deeply into principles of learning and adaptation as they manifest across a wider range of biological, human, and technological systems. The training program includes an intensive computational basecamp, custom course modules on intelligent adaptive systems, lab rotations, communication skills development workshops, and industry networking opportunities. Taken together, these NRT activities will enable the trainees to achieve conceptual and technical capabilities for dealing with large, complex datasets. All NRT trainees will have the opportunity to learn about entrepreneurship, network with industry mentors, engage in professional development, and engage with the local community to educate, disseminate research, and develop outreach partnerships. The NRT program will transform the capacity for interdisciplinary research and education at UC Merced. At the institutional level, the NRT program will serve as a model for collaborative, interdisciplinary graduate education. An extensive recruitment plan will connect with and enhance resources and programs at other UC campuses and a number of Hispanic-Serving Institutions to increase the diversity of scientists and engineers working on intelligent adaptive systems. Finally, the NRT program will have a direct and transformative economic impact in California's Central Valley, by fostering a culture of innovation and higher education in under-privileged communities.

Within all sectors of industry and government, effective decision making depends on the ability of scientists to interpret data and communicate results in a way that supports the decision-making process. This new training program responds to this challenge with an interdisciplinary set of new courses and a suite of activities united by the theme of ""Scientific Training and Research to Inform DEcisions"" (STRIDE). It specifically will include the rarely explicitly taught skills of decision support, such as understanding the perspectives of stakeholders, science communication, and translating scientific uncertainty. The project anticipates training 90 PhD students, including at least 20 funded doctoral trainees, and a similar number of non-trainee MS and PhD students that will participate in program components from the departments of atmospheric and marine sciences, ecology and evolution, computer science, biomedical informatics, applied mathematics and statistics, journalism, and advanced computational science. 

STRIDE will initially target environmental sustainability (including climate change, marine ecology and natural resource management, and illegal deforestation) and energy sustainability, and will add population health in the third year. Research in advanced visual data analytics to support decisions will be pervasive in all areas. The cross fertilization between disciplines focused on decision making will prepare students to make discoveries in the domain sciences and will lead to innovations in visual data analytics. To develop research skills in new contexts and to diversify career perspectives, trainees will have summer externships at non-academic partners such as IBM Research, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, with new partners being added each year. The program comprises three major components: 1) a set of specially designed courses on decision support, spatial data analysis, visualization, and communication required for all students; 2) training in a STEM domain discipline; and 3) a set of non-course-based program elements in which all students will participate, including recruitment, skill development, professional development, and personal development. In addition to degrees in their domain-science disciplines, students will receive a graduate certificate from STRIDE after completing the three proposed courses and program activities. Specific innovations to be tested by rigorous evaluation include the seminar course in scientific decision support that will feature many government/industry scientists, decision makers, and journalists remotely leading discussions on the science, societal, and other challenges associated with decision support in their respective fields. Another new course focusing on science communication for decision makers will be provided by the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science in the School of Journalism.

Although university faculty often collaborate across disciplines, most PhD students are still trained in single departments and have little opportunity to work in interdisciplinary teams. Moreover, interdisciplinary courses for undergraduates are not common, so undergraduates are rarely exposed to the power of interdisciplinary problem-solving before entering a graduate program. A lack of interdisciplinary undergraduate courses also creates few opportunities for graduate students to teach in interdisciplinary settings, even though one of the best ways to learn a topic is to teach it. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of California, Santa Barbara, will address these challenges by developing, enhancing, and assessing a recently developed model of interdisciplinary graduate education (Crossroads).  The model will engage faculty and graduate students from multiple disciplines in a yearlong research project that is transferred into the undergraduate classroom. This project will train undergraduate and graduate students to apply multiple disciplines in problem solving, and will be especially attractive to students from under-represented communities who are eager for tools, such as interdisciplinary research, for solving the world's grand challenges. This project will result in the creation and dissemination of a suite of effective, transferable, and scalable professional development activities addressing interdisciplinary teaching and research, which have been evaluated, refined, and tested in a variety of STEM areas.

This project will supplement the existing Crossroads program with a suite of new activities (open to all graduate students) that will provide explicit training in interdisciplinary scholarship and communicating that scholarship to broad audiences. For example, the project will develop workshops that help students articulate and discuss what it means to conduct research ""in a discipline"", to productively collaborate within an interdisciplinary research group, and to effectively communicate science to diverse groups. In addition, Crossroads students will complete a graduate pedagogy course with modules on teaching in an interdisciplinary classroom and on including authentic research in the classroom. The core Crossroads model and the new enhancements will be tested through the in-depth analysis of five Crossroads group projects (two in the area of sustainability and three across all STEM areas). An evaluator will conduct interviews, focus groups and surveys of students and faculty to assess whether participation in Crossroads improved the students' ability to apply approaches and tools from multiple disciplines to solve research problems, work in interdisciplinary teams, and communicate research to individuals outside the discipline.  These assessments will be used to refine the approach as subsequent projects are developed. The Crossroads program will be thoroughly documented and the elements that are most effective, scalable and transferrable across STEM fields will be widely disseminated across the University of California and national education networks.

Physics faculty attitudes toward diversity, merit, and non-cognitive constructs will be assessed as a measure of change readiness.  Participating faculty will then be trained in holistic admissions, a method that is proven to increase diversity in graduate education. The project will develop and validate a non-cognitive assessment tool as part of the holistic admissions packet.  To address retention, faculty will be trained on evidence-based support structures that can help new graduate students manage the difficult first years of graduate school.  Experimental faculty-centered workshops on admissions and retention will be developed and delivered by the project to four partnering programs at three universities (Rochester Institute of Technology, University of Central Florida, and University of Denver) and then at national meetings hosted by the APS. Formative assessments of these workshops throughout the grant period will be used to revise and refine the materials, resulting in an Admissions and Retention Faculty Training Program that may be used by departments across the country. The APS will curate the resulting materials and help facilitate training during and after project completion, ensuring wide dissemination and sustainable impact of proven practices.

Yet graduate students who are both trained for and pushed toward academic jobs remain unprepared for a key responsibility of these jobs: teaching. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to Florida State University will study the design model and effects of a mixed reality integrated training program to provide teaching practice to STEM graduate teaching assistants (GTAs). Integrating 3D virtual reality and body sensory technology, this  training program for STEM GTAs will extend the research and development of current STEM GTA training by enabling STEM GTAs to practice, observe, and reflect on teaching in a variety of instructional settings, and it will provide them with a deep understanding of teaching strategies through active experimentation and problem solving. The resulting STEM GTA teaching training model is anticipated to improve teaching in introductory STEM courses, to improve the persistence of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines by broadening the teaching practices used in introductory STEM courses, and to address specific challenges and needs associated with the variety of STEM graduate students. The project will employ an iterative evaluation process to improve the model over the course of the award, and the results will inform understanding of the effectiveness of technology-integrated professional development for student instructors. 

The project team will design and develop a mixed-reality integrated teaching training program for STEM GTAs comprised of three components: (1) Environment, a 3D mixed-reality platform, called MILE (Mixed reality Integrated Learning Environment), that enables the simulation and immersive practice of teaching in a variety of contexts; (2) Activity, a semi-structured, MILE-based training program that integrates formal group training sessions with informal self-regulated teaching rehearsal; and (3) Simulated scenarios for skills development, a collection of problem-based teaching scenarios for STEM GTAs to experience in MILE, which will contextualize targeted STEM teaching skills. Adopting a design-based research approach, this project will encompass iterative design processes to refine the mixed-reality integrated teaching training program, and examine its impact on the development of teaching self-efficacy and competence in an interdisciplinary group of STEM GTAs. Data will be collected via both qualitative and quantitative methods to build up a body of evidence on the design generalizations and effectiveness of the mixed-reality integrated teaching training program for STEM GTAs. The project team includes faculty from diverse disciplines including educational psychology and learning systems, computer science, chemistry, and physics.

The long-established apprenticeship model for training graduate students, whereby a doctoral student learns from one master advisor, assumes that most graduating Ph.D. students will become faculty members within a university or conduct industry research to address foundational questions in the sciences. Today most Ph.D. chemists do not seek academic appointments and much less basic research is being conducted in the chemical industry. In addition, the knowledge and skill base doctoral students are expected to master continues to expand, while market-like behaviors undertaken by faculty to secure grants, contracts, and patents may create doctoral training contexts in which doctoral research skill development is uneven or unnecessarily extended. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) track to the University of Oklahoma will pilot an innovative graduate curriculum in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry that emphasizes customization of individual student programs and careful monitoring of progress. Learning outcomes and evaluation data will be used to determine if this transformative curriculum effectively promotes efficient individual doctoral training while decreasing the time to degree. This curriculum is anticipated to provide a template for revision and reinvigoration of doctoral programs in the chemical sciences nationwide.  

While the components of this innovative curriculum model are based on recommendations from landmark national studies concerning STEM graduate education, this pilot will test these components within a comprehensive curricular revision project. The curriculum model will employ competency-based assessment, accelerated learning, and concrete milestones to meet the goals of broadening participation in the chemistry Ph.D. program while decreasing the time to degree. Through greater oversight, customized curricula, and the use of student-led Individual Development Plans, the number of graduates per year is expected to increase as a result of minimizing attrition and decreasing the time to degree. Greater emphasis will be placed on professional development and skill sets that reach beyond the traditional, narrow definition of chemistry so graduates will be better positioned to contribute to an increasingly diverse workforce. The effectiveness of the new curriculum will be evaluated by comparison with historical data at the University of Oklahoma and current practices and data from a number of peer institutions. The project will document ""real time"" student and faculty experiences and detail emergent challenges as the curriculum is enacted, thereby delineating how the curriculum model may be best replicated across doctoral programs and serve as a resource for other universities nationwide. Project dissemination will include the development of a web-based toolbox of resources to facilitate widespread adoption of successful components.

The Sustainable Water Development degree will be housed in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, while building upon strengths across the campus in the area of water sustainability and emphasizing the critical roles of both water quality and quantity as well as food and energy production. Major research efforts will address high priority research needs for such communities, including: forecasting, mitigating and adapting to climate variability; innovative solutions for minimizing waste streams and promoting resource recovery; new water treatment infrastructure suitable in scale and associated energy demand for small communities; and management of biogeochemical cycles and agro-ecosystem structure to promote environmental quality. In addition, we will develop a graduate certificate program in Sustainable Water Development available to the entire graduate STEM population at the university, thereby adding valuable specialization to existing degree programs in water-relevant STEM fields (e.g., chemistry, biology, physics and mathematics).

This project will support training for eighty (80) PhD students, including twenty (20) funded trainees, across the disciplines of neuroscience, biomedical engineering and photonics.

Trainees will become versed in the biology of neural function and the development of optical instruments, photo-excitable materials, and imaging techniques to sense and affect neural circuits. NRT trainees will graduate having attended a hands-on neurophotonics technology boot camp, participated in multiple laboratory research rotations, completed a four-course core curriculum, conducted challenging doctoral research in a neurophotonics laboratory, and written a neurophotonics-themed dissertation co-mentored by NRT faculty. The traineeship project will emphasize immersive experiential learning activities and peer-to-peer learning, two educational approaches that have been shown to reinforce learning while simultaneously improving outcomes for STEM trainees, especially underrepresented minorities. Interwoven with educational activities will be a professional preparation program that supports trainee career goals, develops communication skills, and builds professional networks. Trainee learning objectives will focus on identifying important research problems in neurophotonics, applying light-based methods to measure and control neural circuits, working on team-oriented projects, and communicating effectively.

The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through the comprehensive traineeship model that is innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs."

The ocean is the last great frontier on Earth, a major driver of climate and productivity, and a critical resource for humans and wildlife. Managing ocean resources requires scientists and managers to work seamlessly to understand the top-down effects of human actions and the bottom-up effects of climate-change on the ocean system. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) project at Oregon State University (OSU) will prepare a new generation of natural resource scientists and managers who will combine mathematics, statistics, and computer science with environmental and social sciences to study, protect, and manage ocean systems. This traineeship program anticipates preparing sixty-one (61) MS and PhD students, including thirty (30) funded trainees, to work in transdisciplinary research groups on user-inspired problems using large and ever-expanding data resources.  With powerful analytical tools, they will be best equipped to track and study the top-down effects of human actions and the bottom-up effects of climate change on the ocean system. Besides fulfilling current educational gaps in marine science and management, this OSU NRT program promotes: 1) a transformative and scalable new marine science and policy graduate minor that teaches students to quantify and communicate risk and uncertainty of data-based model forecasts and policy scenarios; 2) the discovery of mechanisms that control the response of marine systems to climate change and human pressures; 3) the development of evidence-based practices for recruiting, training, and retaining diverse graduate students and for placing them into a range of successful careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  

Through a combination of technical coursework, communication workshops, national and international internships, stakeholder engagement, peer mentoring, and involvement in transdisciplinary research projects, OSU NRT trainees will learn about the science of big data, risk and uncertainty quantification and communication and sustainability. They will learn tools and techniques to assist communities in managing resources through change and to recover quickly in the event of a disaster. In line with the learning objectives, the training and research will link new developments in mathematical and statistical quantification of risk and uncertainty, complex and large datasets on marine systems emerging from novel sensors, and outreach and engagement of stakeholders who affect, and are affected by, ocean systems.  In addition, students with diverse expertise, developed through internships, will leverage each other's strong disciplinary knowledge and skills as they collaborate to address complex stakeholder-identified climate and policy problems. These collaborations will have the ultimate goal of devising management solutions in the face of change and uncertainty.

Nanomedicine is an emerging paradigm that seeks to develop engineered nanometer size particles to solve key problems in modern medicine, such as early diagnosis of disease and targeted delivery of therapeutics. This field is exciting to students and there is worldwide demand for training in this area. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) track to Northeastern University will translate cutting-edge advances in nanomedicine research into an education model to pilot and test a scalable, interactive network that empowers low-resource institutions to build capacity in nanomedicine training and develop degree programs in this emerging field.  This project will create a reciprocal knowledge-sharing relationship among a large national pool of students across five institutions. The successful implementation of this new model of higher education is expected to broaden the participation of minorities in the nanomedicine workforce thus reducing disparities in the health workforce, establish new degree programs, and serve as a blueprint for the creation of similar education programs in other disciplines. 

The goal of the project is to create a scalable network for knowledge delivery and scientific collaboration that is designed to enable student learning from expert instructors as well as from peers unrestricted by geographical location. The partners include five research universities with a tradition of providing higher education to underrepresented communities ? Northeastern University, University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez, Tuskegee University, Morgan State University, and Florida International University.  The project will offer synchronous content through live, web-based videoconferencing protocols, allowing students to interact with instructors and peers at other universities in real-time. A parallel enterprise-level online learning environment will be created to enable team-based discussions and assignments. Courses to be offered include Introduction to Nanomedicine, Nanomedicine Research Techniques, Nano/Biomedical Commercialization, and a Nanomedicine Seminar Series.  Faculty facilitators at each institution will coordinate the physical and online classroom environments, contribute to cross-institutional assignments, and provide supplementary instruction. Students will receive degree credit at their home institution through the establishment of course-equivalency at each partner institution. The implementation of these learning tools, together with the assessment of student learning, student demographics, and career development, is expected to generate sufficient new knowledge to enable expansion of this new and unique higher education model to a nationwide program.

However, it has been demonstrated that engaging in teaching in conjunction with research can promote graduate students? skills relevant to research, without increasing the time to graduation. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) to Drexel University is a pilot to address the need to develop mechanisms to train STEM graduate students to effectively teach undergraduate students.  This project will develop and test a new model of graduate education that will enable students to train in educational methods as part of their graduate career and earn an additional advanced degree in STEM education.     
	
The project will support the professional development of STEM graduate students as educators through four targeted goals to (1) train graduate students in evidence-based pedagogical approaches, (2) provide a mechanism for STEM graduate students to earn an MS in Undergraduate STEM Education in addition to their chosen technical PhD, (3) maintain student interest in diverse careers in the professoriate, and (4) support faculty development.  The program will leverage the national UTeach program model, currently being replicated at the undergraduate level at Drexel University through the DragonsTeach program.  The new courses, including a capstone internship, mentoring activities, and the new degree program will be developed as a cross-university collaboration among STEM education and content faculty and will emphasize the importance of deep content knowledge and research-based pedagogy.  To evaluate this pilot, data will be collected on student outcomes and perceptions, faculty perceptions, as well as the value and costs of the pedagogical training as part of a graduate program to determine whether this model is sustainable and transferrable to other institutions.

Distinct barriers of communication exist between the social sciences and the biological or life sciences in the academy. Scholars from each are trained to produce knowledge from a discipline-specific perspective, and seldom have the opportunity, as students, to engage in cross-disciplinary inquiry. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to Temple University brings together scientists from the departments of Geography and Urban Studies (Social Sciences) and Biology (Life Sciences) to pilot a model for cross-disciplinary learning and communication that will use studios as a collaborative learning space and a science museum as a venue for public communication. The project will contribute to wider academic reflection about the production of body-centered knowledge and the role of university partnerships to share this knowledge. 

The goal of the project is to prepare graduate students in the social and life sciences to communicate with each other and with the public by focusing on one broad commonality - the drive to produce knowledge about the human body. The body is a complex phenomenon that is simultaneously biological and social, and thus represents a strategic thematic focus for interdisciplinary collaboration. The model of interdisciplinary graduate education to be developed and tested will use the design studio approach, which asks students to structure inquiry around an ill-defined problem. Graduate student learning will be organized around two sequential design studios and an interactive exhibit. This series is sequential in that each stage demands a broader audience around which to focus design problems. Students in the first studio will design for intra-classroom communication; while in the second studio, they will design for outside audiences and receive feedback from students in middle school, high school, and undergraduate classrooms. Prototypes developed in the design studios will be transformed into exhibits to be presented to public audiences at the Franklin Institute, a science museum in Philadelphia, PA. Student learning will be tracked and evaluated, as will the impacts of outreach activities on students and families. As such, the project seeks to collect data on the effectiveness of this model for interdisciplinary graduate education and university-museum partnerships that could be more broadly scaled and adapted.

The United States has led scientific advancement and education in biomedical science and engineering for the past 50 years empowered by a stellar scientific workforce. As non-traditional career paths continue to expand, the majority of science and engineering PhD graduates increasingly choose careers outside academia, such as teaching, entrepreneurship, policy, and research in industry or government.  However, most graduate programs train students for academic careers, thereby failing to adequately acquaint students with alternative career paths, or provide them with the basic tools and experiences to succeed in multiple professional sectors. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Pathfinders) will focus on a pilot training program that will provide trainees in biomedical sciences and engineering with career development opportunities and investigate its effectiveness in comparison to two non-trainee cohorts. The pilot training program appropriately targets preparing graduate students for a wider range of career pathways through professional skills development and increased awareness of and preparation for non-academic career pathways.

The objectives of this innovative testbed project are to foster career path awareness via multiple platforms, to provide longitudinal professional path mentoring, and to devise and enact individualized development plans for acquiring workplace skills and career path-specific competencies. The pilot will involve a carefully selected diverse cohort to be trained in making informed decisions about career paths and in acquiring the essential competencies to be successful in pursuing their career objectives. Data will be collected on trainee demographic profiles and inclusion, program participation, program quality, satisfaction, time-to-degree, and effectiveness of program content in enhancing career development-ultimately via longitudinal career tracking. Using comprehensive comparisons between trainees and non-trainees, this three-year pilot program will be considered successful if significant differences are identified between cohorts in improving the awareness of and satisfaction with preparation for their preferred career path, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the broad impact and engagement of scientists and engineers in society. The critical elements that contribute significantly to improved career path awareness and preparedness will be identified and these features will be incorporated into larger-scale graduate student training programs at Penn and other institutions. The study outcomes will be disseminated in both local and global settings to inform and improve career advising of biomedical scientists and engineers.

Studies of interdisciplinary research teams indicate that team members struggle to achieve knowledge synthesis across disciplines. Issues arise due to the inability of team members to develop deep knowledge at the frontier of other disciplines and to connect that knowledge with their own expertise to provide a collaborative path forward. The ability to work collaboratively in a research team with others who may hold very different perspectives is a critical aspect of preparing today's students to meet future workforce demands. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) track is a collaborative project led by the University of Texas at El Paso involving graduate students and faculty from multiple institutions.  The project will test a new model for training graduate student teams in environmental sciences to overcome knowledge integration and synthesis challenges.

This model will draw on findings from cognitive, learning, and social sciences to develop and test training for graduate students and faculty in model-based reasoning approaches. Model-based reasoning theory posits that humans reason by constructing an internal mental model of the situations, events, and processes that they encounter, and that external representations can be used to facilitate construction of these mental models. External representations include the use of analogies, metaphor, visual models, diagrams and/or other representations for abstraction and communication of complex concepts. In a team setting, these external representations are called boundary negotiating objects.  This project will place doctoral students in multidisciplinary teams and facilitate a structured, participatory process that includes a progression of standard, individual and group model-based reasoning activities as well as instruction on the purposeful co-creation of boundary negotiating objects.  Students from multiple institutions will learn together through two-week summer experiences; students who are conducting research in conjunction with larger interdisciplinary teams will be targeted.  In addition, the project will train faculty from multiple institution in the model.  The project will examine the implementation of ten faculty members.  Survey, interview, and digital data will be collected to examine how graduate students respond to being directly exposed to theories behind the approach as well as the efficacy of the approach as faculty employ it in their graduate classes. This design will allow comparison of the outcomes from guiding students on what to do, versus teaching students why and how to do it.

This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of California-Berkeley will test improvements to the way undergraduates are introduced to science in research universities through training graduate students to serve as mentors for undergraduate researchers. Undergraduates are often included in research projects as beginning steps to becoming scientists. Research on their experiences points to the formation of good mentoring relationships as a key to positive experiences in these critical first stages in the practice of science. Graduate students, who are often present and actively engaged in supervising undergraduate research projects, have an especially good opportunity to ensure that undergraduates thrive in their research, leading to more undergraduates choosing to continue in science fields. Learning to be good mentors also enhances the career skills of graduate researchers, who go on to be lead scientists in universities and industries. This project will provide new insights into the potential positive effects that providing training for graduate mentors has on undergraduates, on graduate students themselves, and on the national science community.

Building on a successful test-program at UC-Berkeley, this project will pilot and assesses the approach's efficacy in training student mentors from a range of STEM fields and research settings. Participant training will include a semester-long professional development course prior to practicing their new skills while mentoring undergraduate researchers.  Formative evaluation results will be used to refine the training elements and course curricula during two additional iterations of the program.  Data on the effectiveness of the training for graduate students from different disciplines will be used to refine and adapt the training materials for students from different STEM fields and backgrounds. By expanding the test population to include graduate student mentors who do not take the formal mentoring course prior to working with undergraduates, but who use the training materials, the project will assess how the newly developed materials will work for students who are self-guided mentors. This project will produce one of the first systematic investigations of the effects of providing formal training in research mentoring to graduate students, including examining variations among discipline clusters on the effectiveness of different techniques. The project will produce a resource tool-kit for graduate student mentoring of undergraduate researchers that will be made shared on a national level.

The grand challenges in science and engineering require broad professional training for graduate students so they have the skills to successfully communicate technical concepts to diverse audiences. Scientists need to be able to talk with policymakers if public funding of science is to yield benefits to society, and they need to talk with commercial partners to create opportunities for innovation. They need to talk with journalists to keep the public informed. Accordingly, science communication training is increasingly integrated into graduate science education, but there are few methods for determining whether training actually works or whether some training programs work better than others. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Connecticut will develop and test tools to measure whether training in science communication works and to test which methods work best. The innovative pilot will pair science graduate students with journalism majors and include communication skills training in traditional, digital, and social media. The project will bridge disciplines and create assessment tools that can be used across the graduate education community.

The project will develop and test new teaching materials and new innovative tools to evaluate whether the model succeeds in increasing communication effectiveness and activity among science, math, and engineering students. During the pilot, young scientists will be paired with journalists to engage in an interview-write-assess-repeat model. The project will utilize publicly available social media data and evaluations provided by undergraduate students to assess the participating graduate students' effectiveness as communicators. These data will permit comparisons of students before and after training and comparisons of traditional assessment methods with those provided through social media analytics. Social media metrics may also provide a cost- and labor-effective means to track trainees over the course of their careers.  The assessment tools developed and tested in this project will be transferable across disciplines and universities, for the first time permitting cost-benefit comparisons among programs using different training strategies.

Traditional approaches to training first-year graduate students in interdisciplinary fields typically use instructional methods that do not reflect the individualized needs of the students. The course structure additionally teaches laboratory and field methods separately, divorcing context from theory and skills. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Minnesota Duluth will pilot and test a re-design of the first-year graduate studies in limnology. Limnology is an interdisciplinary field that draws graduate students with backgrounds in chemistry, physics, biology, geology, and other disciplines. Thus, an integrated approach that builds from basic concepts toward each of these specialties separately and together is needed. The multi-faceted model will include a flipped-classroom active-learning environment, cohort building, and research experience that involves community partners. This project will make online materials freely available so they can be adapted and utilized by other reform efforts targeting first-year graduate instruction, particularly in interdisciplinary programs. 

A team of professional scientists and educational faculty members with the Large Lakes Observatory will collaborate to establish measurable learning targets involving both scientific knowledge and broader professional skills. Based upon these learning targets, a variety of formative and summative assessment measures will be created and used to help guide the implementation of this project's graduate course material. Students will access course materials and resources outside of class hours, including videotaped lectures, interactive website content, and other online materials. Projects of different durations and scopes will be designed for students to work on inside the classroom as a means to apply information learned from the online course materials. A final capstone project will be created by involving one or more community partners in the field of water resources or water quality, including private companies, government laboratories, and non-profit organizations. These community partners will propose a real-world challenge that students will work on as a team to design solutions and develop deliverables. This new educational model will serve to integrate and improve delivery of basic concepts, build teamwork and communication skills among the students, and further connect the academic community to local partners.

Twenty-first century scientists and engineers must possess skills that enable them to reach beyond the laboratory, across disciplines and into communities to identify issues and develop solutions that increase both resilience and sustainability. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Georgia will pilot an approach adapted from health sciences training to provide newly matriculating doctoral students with targeted skills training. The results of this pilot study will advance our understanding of the impact of early, immersive professional development on the contributions that students can make to research during their graduate studies, as well as longer term impact on career placement and success. 

The goals of this project are to: 1) determine key considerations in transferring this pedagogical model from the health professions, in which it was established, to broad STEM domains; 2) determine the effect of providing skills training at the beginning of a student?s graduate career; and 3) develop best practices for sustainably implementing the model, should it prove to be effective in this context. Students participating in this pilot will engage initially in an eight-week summer boot camp before their first semester of graduate studies to help them develop targeted transferable professional skills in collaboration, leadership, and community engagement. They will progress to a first-semester Challenge Course in which they will work in small, multidisciplinary teams on a real problem identified in partnership with a Georgia community. Faculty mentors will use a modified challenge-based learning format to guide students through this process so that the process is internalized and carried forward meaningfully in the context of their own research. As students progress through the program, they will further hone their skills and apply their knowledge as they mentor more junior graduate students. Data will be collected to examine the model impact, both on the participating students as well as on the labs in which they work.

This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Tulsa will test the effectiveness of an innovative approach to enhance the professionalism and productivity of engineering graduate students.  Graduate school, as it currently exists, enables students to acquire concrete technical skills with admirable efficiency.  To complete their preparation as professionals, however, graduate students also need to develop non-technical skills, such as leadership, conflict management, and adaptability.  This pilot project will develop a novel professional development system that provides graduate students a mental framework to practice these non-technical skills and uses an online tool to facilitate and track professional development.  

The primary goal of this test-bed project will be to develop and assess a novel program that enables the intentional practice of non-technical skills.  Intentional practice is a deliberate process where a skill is broken down into parts and there is focus on improving a particular part, frequently with immediate feedback from a coach.  This research will answer three central questions: What are the core professional competencies that are essential for successful graduate students? Can approaches developed and validated in workplace settings be adapted to improve graduate student professionalism? Does increased professionalism improve graduate student productivity, retention, and success?  These questions will be answered through a set of online assessment tracking tools that will capture student self-assessments and peer and advisor assessments.  Students will be mentored on how to make intentional decisions about professional development opportunities and how to develop the ability to be intentional about practicing these professional skills.  Qualitative assessments will be coupled to objective measures of student performance, such as productivity and graduation rate, to determine if the competency development approach is successful.

This project brings together a highly interdisciplinary team from biology, physics, strategic communication, journalism, theater, creative writing, and visual design to develop and test the means of evaluating the effectiveness of communication training in graduate programs. The novel pilot will draw on communication research outside the sciences and use statistical evaluation of training effectiveness from multiple points of view, including the public's. The project will result in tools and procedures graduate training programs could use to assure the quality of communications training, and eventually provide better communication between scientists and others.
 
Despite widespread agreement on the need for better science communication and a proliferation of training programs, there is little evidence about what approaches actually improve scientists' communication skills. An interdisciplinary team will develop a controlled test bed for communication training in science graduate programs. Longitudinal studies will assess trainees' acquisition and retention over five learning modules. A rigorous statistical design will relate trainees' self-evaluations and instructors' evaluations to responses to survey instruments by hundreds of non-science audience members. Statistical comparison of pre-, post-, and no-training impacts on audiences will establish effectiveness. Trainees will come from the life sciences and later from physical sciences to determine the program's transferability among disciplines. These experiments will provide an innovative model for training evaluation that can be adopted by other programs at relatively low cost.

The availability of voluminous, high resolution data in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, coupled with increasingly fast, distributed computational resources offers enormous opportunities for tackling complex engineering and science challenges in urban settings. These data can also play an important role in interdisciplinary problem solving and have increasingly high value to multiple communities of scientists and engineers. However, research in the optimal instruction mechanisms to develop data science skills is still emerging. This is particularly true for engineering graduate students, who are a highly selected, technologically sophisticated population with the ability to quickly master material. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of California-Davis will pilot, test, and compare modes of data science instruction.  The testbed project will provide critical new information to inform the development of new learning platforms designed to cultivate robust computational, statistical, and data reasoning skills in engineering graduate students. 

The project will implement a hybrid short-course approach that 1) bridges existing code camps and semester long classes, and 2) is coupled with a formal user group experience. A robust evaluation will be conducted to identify the individual effects of code camps, short courses, and users groups, as well as the effect of participating in combinations of experiences.  In addition, learning gains, self-efficacy to engage in interdisciplinary studies that require data science principles, and career trajectories (including decisions to take additional coursework in data science and decisions to pursue interdisciplinary research and employment involving data science) will be examined. The project will generate new knowledge that addresses a particularly important gap in knowledge in terms of whether intense short-term learning experiences result in longer-term retention of skill development and computational reasoning.  Findings on effectiveness of different modes of data science instruction in engineering will be broadly applicable to all data-enabled science and engineering fields.

Graduate students are trained to write for discipline-specific journals, but they typically receive little instruction in communicating to public and non-specialist audiences. This lack of practical training persists despite the importance of engaging members of the public in scientific research to support policy decisions and science literacy. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Rhode Island will address this gap and promote students? scientific learning through communication and engagement. The model to be tested is a training program in academic and non-academic science writing for both graduate students and science faculty, which will include a series of courses, workshops, and internships, the development of a Graduate Science Writing Center, and an emphasis on a variety of writing projects. This project will contribute to the next generation of scientists who can communicate with other scientists and the public and will train a set of faculty who support students in that work. 

The primary goal of this program is to work with graduate students and faculty to implement a new cross-disciplinary model of science communication training that integrates diverse types of science writing and communication from the beginning of and throughout graduate students' scientific training. A key to the training model offered is grounding in rhetoric, the academic discipline devoted to the persuasive power of language that includes studies of argument, public discourse, and civic engagement. The rhetorical approach will have three distinct features: habitual writing, multiple genres, and frequent review. Graduate students will write early and often to create a habit of writing. They will practice writing across multiple genres for academic and non-academic audiences. Graduate science writers will plan and draft their writing and then enter a process of review and revision in one-on-one and small group tutorials in classrooms, online peer review forums, and a Graduate Science Writing Center. Workshops for cohorts of Graduate Science Writing Fellows, Faculty Science Writing Fellows, and Faculty Science Writing Mentors will provide a rhetorical foundation and serve as a basis for individual, pedagogical, and curricular change. Faculty Fellows will be guided to adjust syllabi and writing projects for their graduate courses to incorporate more writing earlier in their courses and more opportunities for review and revision. Assessment of short-term and long-term student learning outcomes, writing tool adoption by faculty, programmatic outcomes, and project-level management will determine which components will be carried into the future and can serve as a model for similar programs.

In modern life there are many situations requiring people to interact with computers, either so that they may learn from the machine or so that the machine may learn from them. The applications in education, industry, health, robotics, and national security hint at the enormous societal and economic benefits arising from research into the technologies that promote learning in both people and computers. Yet the potential has been difficult to realize because such research requires scientists with expertise in quite different fields of study. While computer scientists receive training in complex computational ideas and methods, they know little about how people learn and behave. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Wisconsin-Madison will prepare trainees with data-enabled science and engineering training to simultaneously understand computational theory and methods, the mechanisms that support human learning and behavior, and the ways these mechanisms behave in complex real-world situations. The traineeship anticipates equipping forty (40) doctoral students with the skills and expertise necessary to advance our understanding of human and machine learning and teaching, through a new training program that focuses on learning, understanding, cognition, intelligence, and data science.

This project will train doctoral students from computer science, engineering, cognitive psychology, and education sciences, with the goal of promoting a common knowledge base that allows these scientists to work productively across traditional boundaries on both basic research questions and practical, real-world problems. The traineeship will include several graduate training innovations: (1) a project-focused ""prof-and-peer"" mentoring system where scientists work in cross-disciplinary teams to address a shared research problem, (2) close involvement of partners in industry, government, and non-profit sectors to develop research problems with real-world application, (3) an information outreach effort that trains scientists to communicate with the public, industry, and policy-makers through traditional and new media outlets, (4) a flexible development plan that allows each trainee to garner the cross-disciplinary expertise needed to advance a particular research focus, and (5) new mechanisms for recruiting and retaining under-represented groups in STEM research. This training will prepare US scientists to compete globally at the highest levels for positions in science, industry, and government, in a growth sector of the 21st century knowledge economy.

This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award engages faculty and students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in a new graduate education model that brings together life scientists, physical scientists and engineers.  To prepare highly skilled STEM students for the modern economy of the 21st century, the project will provide training breadth across multiple professional and technical skill areas while developing depth in the trainee's area of specialization. The program will serve masters and doctoral students in the disciplines of polymer science and engineering, immunology, food science, and several engineering fields. The traineeship anticipates preparing seventy-four (74) graduate students, including twenty-eight (28) funded trainees, many of whom will direct their career aims beyond research or academia to work in industry, government, and teaching-intensive professional jobs. Trainees will develop dynamic interdisciplinary and professional skills to catalyze innovation in materials research, such as new drug delivery methods and personalized health monitoring devices.  

The research theme of applying polymeric materials to technical challenges in the life sciences will serve as the basis for meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration. The research theme, from which collaborative research projects will spring, will feature two primary concentrations: Engineering Immunological Soft Materials (enabling immunologists to collaborate with polymer specialists) and Materials for Sensor Monitoring (supporting collaborations between engineers and polymer scientists). A goal of the training program is to build T-shaped skills, in which the vertical bar on the ""T"" represents the depth of related skills and expertise in a single field, and the horizontal bar is the ability to collaborate across disciplines with experts in other areas and to apply knowledge in areas of expertise other than one's own. The program will feature an intensive ""Year Two Experience"" that combines an interdisciplinary course in technical topics related to the research theme, professional development workshops and training activities, and interdisciplinary lab modules. Students who complete all requirements will earn a graduate certificate in Soft Materials for Life Sciences. Connections to industry, facilitated by the Institute for Applied Life Sciences, will benefit the trainees and strengthen the broader science ecosystem.  The project outcomes will be a demonstrated, well-evaluated model for transformative graduate training that is effective in developing T-shaped professionals. A science-of-science study conducted throughout the NRT project will explore the dynamics and efficacy of interdisciplinary collaboration by students in this program.

The world's demographics are changing. People continue to live longer and the U.S. population is becoming older and more racially and ethnically diverse. There is also an increase in younger individuals living with a life-long disability, such as veterans who sustain catastrophic injuries, persons suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, and children growing up with developmental disorders or delays.  With this changing population profile comes an increasing demand for advanced healthcare technologies and a need to train a new generation of engineers able to develop these new technologies. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to the Georgia Institute of Technology will address this demand by training graduate master's and doctoral students in the interdisciplinary field of healthcare robotics. The traineeship anticipates providing a unique and comprehensive training opportunity for one hundred and fifty-five (155) students, including thirty (30) funded trainees, by combining disciplines in robotics, studies in health sciences, interactions with clinical partners, hands-on rehabilitation research, and a culture of innovation and translational research. 

Trainees will have unique exposure to a variety of approaches developed in Robotics, Physiology, Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, and Psychology. The traineeship will bridge the gap between healthcare and robotics by addressing two major barriers:  a) the lack of a formalized framework to enable interdisciplinary collaborations between robotics engineers and health professionals; b) the tendency for students in robotics to be unprepared to address problems in healthcare, including a lack of appreciation for the challenges encountered by clinicians, caregivers, and people with disabilities.  Through close interactions with various partners, the traineeship will expand student horizons beyond a technology-first mentality to consider challenges in developing robotic solutions that address the needs of clinicians, caregivers, and people with disabilities.  The goal is to develop an interdisciplinary curriculum based upon the concept of participatory design, problem-based learning, and an immersive research experience that blends techniques from multiple disciplines to solve problems posed in healthcare.  A second major goal of the traineeship is to increase the participation of women, underrepresented minorities, and students with disabilities in robotics and related engineering fields. The project will develop a new M.S. degree program in healthcare robotics and a new PhD concentration area in healthcare robotics as well as curricular materials and best-practices to allow other institutions to develop similar programs.

Infectious diseases are an ongoing threat to human health, animal health, and social stability. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) project prepares doctoral students at the University of Georgia with data-enabled science and engineering training to solve complex, interdisciplinary problems related to diseases and the environment. Effectively predicting where new infectious agents will go next, how fast they will spread, and how severely humans or other species may be impacted requires a basic knowledge of how hosts and pathogens interact at different scales of biological organization (e.g., cell, organism, population), as well as the ability to identify how processes taking place at one scale respond to or affect processes occurring at adjacent scales. This traineeship anticipates preparing thirty (30) doctoral students, including twenty (20) funded trainees, with mastery of both empirical and computational dimensions of contemporary infectious disease problems. 

Research activities associated with the program focus on three topical areas critical to unraveling the complexity of host-pathogen interactions in nature: co-infection and pathogen interactions; environmental change and disease dynamics; and tipping points and early warning signals. Faculty from thirteen academic units with empirical expertise spanning single cells to whole ecosystems, and quantitative expertise in statistical modeling, mathematical modeling, stochastic processes, adaptive dynamics, machine learning, and geographic mapping will co-mentor student research. This traineeship will use interdisciplinary case study-based teaching, instruction in advanced techniques for computer modeling, and internships at non-academic and international organizations to provide students with the conceptual background, computational skills, and global perspective needed to tackle the most pressing infectious disease problems of our time. In addition, a range of professional development activities including a capstone experience, data clinics, internships, study abroad, and communication training will provide students with the skills to transfer basic knowledge to real world problems in both academic and non-academic settings.

New methods to increase crop productivity are required to meet anticipated demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel. Using modern sensors and data analysis techniques, it is now feasible to develop methods to predict plant growth and productivity based on information about their genome and environment.  However, doing so requires expertise in plant sciences as well as computational sciences and engineering. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Iowa State University will bring together students with diverse backgrounds, including plant sciences, statistics, and engineering, and provide them with data-enabled science and engineering training. The collaborative spirit required for students to thrive in this unique intellectual environment will be strengthened through the establishment of a community of practice to support collective learning.  This traineeship anticipates preparing forty-eight (48) master's and doctoral students, including twenty-eight (28) funded doctoral students, with the understanding and tools to design and construct crops with desired traits that can thrive in a changing environment.  

Understanding how particular genetic traits result in given plant characteristics under specific environmental conditions is a core goal of modern biology that will facilitate the efficient development of crops with commercially useful characteristics. Plant characteristics are influenced by genetics and a wide range of environmental factors, including, for example, rainfall, temperature and soil types. Developing methods to effectively integrate these diverse inputs that take advantage of existing biological, statistical, and engineering knowledge will be a key area in this research and training program that will bring together faculty from eight departments. Trainees will engage in cutting-edge research and development areas involving direct data collection and analysis from living plants, including sensor development, high throughput robotic technology, and biological feature extraction through image analysis. This traineeship will use the T-training model to provide students with training across a broad range of disciplines while developing a deep technical expertise in one area. This expertise, in combination with soft skills development, will enable the trainees to work across organizational and cultural boundaries as well as scientific disciplines. To develop understanding of how to share knowledge with diverse groups, the program will provide students with training beyond traditional coursework and research through activities that will develop advanced communication and entrepreneurship skills. Additionally, internship opportunities in industry, national labs, and other settings will equip trainees to choose among the diverse career paths available to scientists and engineers.

Accelerating the discovery of new materials that enable transformative technologies is needed to transform the nation?s energy landscape. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award will create and institutionalize a new training model at Texas A&M University that equips Master?s and doctoral students with the skills to advance research at the interface of materials science, informatics, and engineering design. The traineeship addresses the data-enabled science and engineering research priority theme and tackles three main challenges: 1) the need to accelerate materials discovery and development, particularly in energy-related technologies; 2) the need to instill in scientists and engineers the capability to transform data into knowledge, and use this knowledge to discover and design advanced materials; and 3) the need to educate scientists and engineers who internalize the interdisciplinary research process. The project anticipates preparing eighty (80) master?s and doctoral students, including forty-one (41) funded trainees, through an interdisciplinary curriculum in materials science, design, and informatics enriched with energy and entrepreneurship-related courses and activities. 

This traineeship will involve faculty from two colleges and six departments with expertise in materials science, engineering design, and informatics as well as in graduate education and curriculum development. The program will closely align the desired technical and professional skills, curriculum innovations, and learning outcomes. The pedagogical model will include mediated, relational, situated and transformative components. Collaboration will be embedded throughout the program, particularly in the development of learning communities, internships, and the capstone Materials Design Studio. This traineeship will equip graduate students with the necessary knowledge and experience, interdisciplinary focus, and technical and professional skills (including communication, collaboration, leadership) to thrive in a range of career options including industry, academia, and national research laboratories.  It will also equip entrepreneurship-minded trainees with the knowledge and experience necessary to pursue deployment and commercialization of technologies generated from their research. The program will contain strong education research and rigorous evaluation components, which will enable refinement of effective and novel approaches and dissemination of the training model to the wider graduate education community.

By the year 2030, six out of every ten people in the world are projected to live in a city. To support the continuing influx of citizens, cities must be prepared to handle large-scale issues concerning urban populations, such as public health, sustainable use of limited energy resources, emergency preparedness, and societal stability. ""Big data"" methods hold great promise in addressing such issues because a great amount of operational data is being gathered as our cities become more wired and networked. This NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Virginia Tech will emphasize data-enabled science and engineering education and collaboration across a range of fields to prepare doctoral students to become interdisciplinary data scientists who can help realize the promises of unprecedented urbanization. The traineeship anticipates training up to sixty (60) doctoral students, including eighteen (18) funded students, which will contribute to the United States? workforce and thus support our national competitiveness.

Trainees will pursue a PhD in one of eight home departments: computer science, mathematics, statistics, electrical and computer engineering, population health sciences, urban affairs and planning, civil and environmental engineering, and sociology. Specific educational innovations will include: i) a ?tapestry? curriculum to support early weaving of interdisciplinary issues, ii) emphasis on ethical and societal issues for responsible data science, iii) community building through interdisciplinary project teams and data analytics competitions, and iv) effective communication skills to facilitate interactions with a broad range of urban city professionals, i.e., the end consumers of data science. Trainees will learn how to model cities, develop large-scale statistical models, and use data mining and visualization technologies to pose and answer questions. Trainees will use Virginia Tech?s Urban Living Laboratory to enable collaborations with regional industries, local city governments (Arlington, VA), and local health departments (Virginia Department of Health) via internships, practicums, data challenges, and hackathons.  The project will actively recruit a diverse cadre of students to tackle this timely challenge of urban computational modeling.  The training model will be evaluated using a mixed method (quantitative and qualitative) approach and target five focus areas (students, community, research, program, scalability and sustainability).

The United States has built tremendous infrastructure for remotely measuring many aspects of the Earth's physical environment to provide benefits to society, such as satellites, radars, telescopes, and cameras. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has challenged the scientific community to expand the uses of this Earth observation infrastructure to generate new knowledge and provide additional societal benefits beyond those that were initially envisioned. This National Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Oklahoma addresses this challenge by developing and testing a new model for training master's and doctoral students to use existing Earth observation data in new approaches to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. The traineeship program will implement and evaluate an interdisciplinary coursework program in Earth-observation for Science, Society, and Sustainability (EOS3) and an interdisciplinary research immersion program. This traineeship anticipates preparing one hundred and twenty (120) graduate students, including thirty (30) funded trainees, across three universities in the emerging discipline of aeroecology. 

Aeroecology focuses on understanding the interactions of animals in the aerosphere (lower atmosphere). Aeroecology is emerging from the interface of biology, meteorology, geography, and computer science and has strong connections to social sciences both through environmental science and concerns about human health and safety. Engineering advances are transforming the aerosphere from a vast open space into a resource that we use for communication (cell phone towers), energy production (wind turbines), and transportation (aircraft and unmanned aerial systems). These mounting incursions into the aerosphere drive a need to understand and manage a new suite of human-biodiversity interactions and conflicts. This NRT project will build on unique strengths of the training consortium in aeroecology as a rapidly growing new use of Earth-observation data. The NRT will originate at the University of Oklahoma, replicate first at the University of Delaware, then at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and later radiate to additional consortium institutions across the nation. This NRT model will include training in communication, data analytics, team-based science skills, and entrepreneurship. Externship opportunities with private, government, and non-profit organizations will also help trainees gain professional skills in local, national, and international settings. Each participating institution will foster diversity through the implementation of best practices for inclusiveness in recruiting, retaining, and mentoring of graduate students. Rigorous evaluation of the impact of the NRT model on student learning, faculty development, and institutional change will inform future efforts to broadly improve interdisciplinary graduate education.

Microbes play a vital role in shaping almost every ecosystem on the planet. Understanding the capabilities of microbes and their microbial communities (microbiomes) is the foundation for a range of transformative discoveries essential for sustaining life and the environment. However, the numerous disciplines studying and working with microbes often operate in silos resulting from the lack of a shared knowledge base and common analytical processes, thus limiting the potential to develop novel applications. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award will bring together biologists, engineers, computer scientists and biostatisticians at Duke University and North Carolina Agricultural and Technology State University to fill this gap. The traineeship anticipates preparing one hundred (100) doctoral students, including forty-five (45) funded trainees across the two institutions, to solve both current and the next generation of challenges in data-enabled science and engineering microbiome research.

Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic (meta?omic) analyses in combination with advanced bioinformatic tools present a powerful approach for obtaining key insights into the complex microbial interactions underlying microbiome composition and function. Academic institutions have often struggled to keep pace with the growing and diverse meta?omics training demands of their students. This traineeship will address these training gaps by creating a novel and replicable education model where microbiologists, engineers, statisticians, and other empirical scientists will be cross-trained with theorists, model builders, and computational scientists. Trainees will learn to effectively work in interdisciplinary teams, engage in exciting research in environmental engineering and science, biomedical engineering, microbial genetics, biostatistics, and bioinformatics, and share discoveries within their cohort. Targeted interactions with practitioners will provide trainees with an understanding of real world challenges, competencies in various communication tools, collaborative skills utilized in the workforce, and an exposure to a wide range of careers. By instilling breadth of knowledge and cross-disciplinary awareness, the traineeship will foster creative integration and ultimately acceleration of discovery while helping to provide the nation?s workforce with students equipped with interdisciplinary skills to address global challenges including restoring ecosystems, developing innovative metabolic engineering pathways and engineering the next generation of therapies. Finally, through immersion of trainees in an array of outreach activities, a community will be developed with the motivation and skills to promote science and engineering to the broader population with goals of broad and substantial engagement of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.

Both environmental preservation and human uses of plants require knowledge of plant form and function, from the molecular to ecosystem perspectives, and spanning single-celled, aquatic organisms to domesticated agricultural species and their wild relatives, to the tallest trees. Plant research underpinned the Green Revolution, and is now being called upon to address a range of challenges in food, health and the environment. Because of the breadth of plant science and its associated experimental technologies, the field faces significant headwinds to address multilateral, multidisciplinary experimental questions. This project will form the Coordinated Plant Science Research and Education Network, a network of research and education societies with involvement in plant science research that continues and amplifies a successful effort to unite a broad spectrum of plant scientists around a strategic plan called the Decadal Vision that was published in 2013. The Network has two major goals: (1) to catalyze interdisciplinary training and research by encouraging and facilitating information exchange among its six founding member societies, a number intended to grow; and (2) to use dedicated workshops to seek novel solutions to broaden participation in plant sciences, and to re-examine how postdoctoral fellows should be trained in the plant sciences. Improved cross-talk between different stripes of experimental plant scientists, and with those contributing enabling technologies from imaging to robotics to informatics, promises to enrich and enliven the plant community, while leading to exciting and empowering fundamental discoveries about the wonders of plants. 

By serving as a forum through which plant science constituencies coordinate their efforts to advance plant science research, education, and innovation, the Coordinated Plant Science Research and Education Network will coordinate and facilitate a successful effort by the broader plant community to establish a consensus-driven set of priorities which culminated in the 2013 publication of ""Unleashing a Decade of Innovation in Plant Science: A vision for 2015-2025"". The founding members of the Network are the American Society of Plant Biologists, the Alliance of Crop, Soil and Environmental Science Societies, the American Phytopathological Society, the American Society for Horticultural Science, the Botanical Society of America, the Genetics Society of America, and the Council on Undergraduate Research. The Network will be open to any interested scientific professional associations and will proactively engage other organizations with an interest in the study of plants. One of the main goals of the Network is to serve as a clearinghouse for the research, education and outreach activities and opportunities for its members and the wider plant science community. Expected outcomes include new collaborations among societies and scientists, including new interdisciplinary collaborative research projects that will advance the frontiers of plant sciences, and innovative recruitment and training strategies for the next generation of scientists required for excellence in U.S. plant science research. The Network will also convene two workshops, on broadening participation and postdoctoral training that aim to catalyze career building and diversification within the plant science workforce. To communicate the wonder and importance of plant research, the Network will develop a shared set of consistent messages to the public, including authoritative, science-based information on key societally relevant topics. Internal and external communication for the Network will be through Plantae.org, a modular web interface custom designed to serve the needs of the Network and members of the broader plant science community."

The oceanographic community is on the cusp of two major advances that have the potential to transform understanding of the Southern Ocean. The first is the development of new biogeochemical sensors mounted on autonomous profiling floats that allow sampling of ocean biogeochemistry and acidification in 3-dimensional space with a temporal resolution of five to ten days. The SOCCOM float program proposed will increase the average number of biogeochemical profiles measured per month in the Southern Ocean by ~10-30x. The second is that the climate modeling community now has the computational resources and physical understanding to develop fully coupled climate models that can represent crucial mesoscale processes in the Southern Ocean, as well as corresponding models that assimilate observations to produce a state estimate. Together with the observations, this new generation of models provides the tools to vastly improve understanding of Southern Ocean processes and the ability to quantitatively assess uptake of anthropogenic carbon and heat, as well as nutrient resupply, both today and into the future.

In order to take advantage of the above technological and modeling breakthroughs, SOCCOM will implement the following research programs:
* Theme 1: Observations. Scripps Institution of Oceanography will lead a field program to expand the number of Southern Ocean autonomous profiling floats and equip them with sensors to measure pH, nitrate, and oxygen. The University of Washington and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute will design, build, and oversee deployment of the floats. Scripps will also develop a mesoscale eddying Southern Ocean state estimate that assimilates physical and biogeochemical data into the MIT ocean general circulation model.
* Theme 2: Modeling. University of Arizona and Princeton University, together with NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), will use SOCCOM observations to develop data/model assessment metrics and next-generation model analysis and evaluation, with the goal of improving process level understanding and reducing the uncertainty in projections of our future climate.

Led by Climate Central, an independent, non-profit journalism and research organization that promotes understanding of climate science, SOCCOM will collaborate with educators and media professionals to inform policymakers and the public about the challenges of climate change and its impacts on marine life in the context of the Southern Ocean. In addition, the integrated team of SOCCOM scientists and educators will:
* communicate data and results of the SOCCOM efforts quickly to the public through established data networks, publications, broadcast media, and a public portal;
* train a new generation of diverse ocean scientists, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows versed in field techniques, data calibration, modeling, and communication of research to non-scientists;
* transfer new sensor technology and related software to autonomous instrument providers and manufacturers to ensure that they become widely useable."

This grant is in support of the organization and conduct of a workshop related to identifying the capabilities of a web-based platform that will serve as a repository for educational materials in the field of sustainable engineering. The overall objective of the workshop is to bring together experts in education, sustainable engineering, and development of high-use web platforms to discuss two aspects of the proposed platform. The first aspect is to identify the most important activities and web platform features that would attract educators across the country and eventually globally to contribute materials for posting on the platform. There are numerous barriers that could prevent educators from contributing their materials, and discussions at the workshop will specifically address ways to overcome them. The second aspect is to identify the most important activities and web platform features that would attract educators around the world to download and make use of materials posted on the platform. To facilitate this goal, current learning systems, some with sustainability content, will be demonstrated. Experts will present state-of-the-art instructional design and strategies that promise to increase course preparation and teaching efficiency as well as student learning. Barriers to widespread use of such materials will also be discussed, and ways of overcoming them will be addressed. The output of the workshop will be a summary document on the results of these discussions that will enable serious thought on development of a web platform repository for sustainable engineering education materials. The methods to be employed in the workshop include plenary talks, panel discussions, open question and answer periods, and breakout group discussions.

The proposed workshop has the potential to develop a blueprint for a web platform that could have a major effect on education in sustainable engineering. Hundreds of U.S. universities with engineering programs are currently inventing educational materials, courses, and curricula in the burgeoning field of sustainable engineering. There is a lack of coordination among these universities, with significant repetition of efforts to develop new educational materials. Coordinating content across multiple engineering disciplines offers an opportunity to generalize, cross-fertilize and more efficiently use content generally. Existing computer technology can make the process of educating the nation's engineers much more efficient. This is of great importance in a world of finite resources and a rapidly growing population as well as rapidly growing standards of living. Engineers are being tasked with solving many of the world's most pressing problems, and thus training these engineers to understand the constraints of twenty-first century is an urgent need. This project addresses this need using state-of-the-art equipment and methods. Diversity will be sought in all aspects of the project - the attendees of the workshop will be from several underrepresented groups, and from underserved institutions across multiple engineering disciplines. But the proposed workshop is expected to have an impact far beyond the workshop attendees. In particular, working toward a repository for educational materials in sustainable engineering accessible by everyone has the potential to benefit educators everywhere, and that can ultimately benefit engineering students everywhere. This work is thus the start of a multi-step process that has the potential to enhance the nation's educational infrastructure and benefit the nation's practicing engineers and thus society at large. This award is co-funded by two divisions in EHR (DUE and DGE) and three divisions in ENG (EEC, CMMI, and CBET)."

The crux of this deliberative model approach is to focus on the practical dilemmas that arise.  This approach enables students to isolate and clarify the various sources of conflict about environmental issues. Students will learn to identify three sources of conflict: those that stem from disagreements over moral principles and ideals; those that stem from differences in political commitments, economic interests and legal interpretation; and those that stem from differences in scientific understanding of environmental issues including different assessments of risk and uncertainty. The educational resources are designed to help students draw more effectively on the literature in environmental ethics, including some of the seminal classic texts by Leopold, Muir, and Thoreau, as well as more contemporary texts in applied ethics as they sort through environmental debates of social concern. With a richer understanding of the ethical issues, and an ability to communicate effectively in a public setting, we believe that students will be in a better position to work through and understand the underlying disagreements in a more thoughtful and intelligent manner.

Abstract
Science communications proficiency is an important skill for STEM graduate students but is not a typical part of STEM graduate education nationally. At the institutions that do offer such science communications training, instructional approaches are highly variable, reflecting an absence of standards and evaluation metrics. The workshop will 1) inventory science communications training for STEM graduate students nationally, (2) identify high effective practices in science communications training with attention to curriculum, approaches, and evaluation, and (3) define a roadmap that gives concrete recommendations to university administrators and funding agencies for national implementation and scale-up of science communications training. The workshop will involve IGERT PIs, science communications trainers, science communications researchers, and individuals from national agencies and organizations with a high interest in STEM graduate student communications training. Products of the workshop will include a white paper to NSF that identifies best practices for science communications training and specifies a roadmap for national scale-up of effective practices; publications in the peer-reviewed literature and other media; and briefings of officials at organizations with capacity to foster changes in graduate education (e.g., NSF, Council of Graduate Schools, and AAAS)."

Intellectual Merit: This program addresses this challenge by focusing on two areas of importance in biotechnology: cells' behaviors based on growth in a variety of environments; and ""systems biology"" - the integrated analysis of numerous molecular changes, particularly those related to gene expression, that occur within cells when exposed to different environments. A key feature of this work is that the environments will be specifically engineered. For example, different materials will be used to support the growth of a particular type of cell. By studying the impact of these controlled environments on the expression of the cell?s genes, one can begin to design strategies to target specific environments for specific applications: growth of cells as tissue replacement for healing, and design of better ways to deliver medicines, among others. The cross-training effort synergizes diverse areas of expertise available at the University of Delaware. 

Broader Impacts: This program addresses a critical question related to biotechnology research: how do molecular changes within a cell relate to the environment in which the cell is exposed? There are many important application areas and our program will provide students with an opportunity to learn critical experimental and computational techniques to best prepare them for careers in the life sciences industry. An emphasis on innovation will provide students with an opportunity to engage in industry internships and public policy, intellectual property workshops, as well as research experiences at institutions around the world.

Intellectual Merit: Changes in the hydrologic cycle are expected to decrease the supply of safe water, forcing vulnerable populations in poor countries to drink dirty water, leading to increased disease. Food production will become scarcer as unsustainable groundwater withdrawals are affected by increased drought. As contaminants continue to flow into water bodies and hydrodynamic patterns adjust to climate change, the coastal fisheries upon which human populations depend for food will face increased problems of eutrophication and anoxia. Integrated strategies are needed for predicting and adapting to climate driven stressors on water resources and human health. Among these strategies are smart growth land use practices resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions or water infrastructure systems that conserve water and energy.

Broader Impacts: The trainees will be scientific leaders and will engage in mentoring diverse high school students. Practical problems will be addressed by students through a capstone course centering on real problems in three very different areas of the world: the Chesapeake Bay watershed in the temperate developed U.S., the tropical underdeveloped Amazon basin in Peru, and the arid underdeveloped Nile basin in Ethiopia.

Intellectual Merit: Key features of the program include: novel interdisciplinary research; shared coursework; an innovative real-time case study of the design, evaluation, and implementation of an offshore wind installation; the use of studios in which interdisciplinary teams work interactively to address real issues in the case study; and research experiences at leading international offshore wind energy institutions. The IGERT will recruit student participants using a multi-tiered approach with particular attention to strong participation by under-represented students. Broader Impacts: The shared experience of the students in the program is designed to provide the intellectual flexibility, cross-disciplinary training and professional skills necessary to move the science, engineering, and development of wind energy forward, leading to the creation of renewable energy projects that are technically and environmentally sound while also being suited to neighboring communities. 

IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future.

Intellectual Merit: Human activities are rapidly changing Earth?s climate. However, model projections of future climate have large uncertainties, due in large part to lack of knowledge about biogeochemical controls and feedbacks that determine future atmospheric concentrations of key greenhouse gases. Predictions of future climate require integrated understanding of these biogeochemical processes across multiple scales in both space and time. This training will also improve communication between empiricists and modelers and to the general public.  

The program starts with three core classes on the principles, observational methods, and quantitative approaches of cross-scale biogeochemistry, followed by three short, intensive modules providing training in microbial methods (Cornell), whole-ecosystem biogeochemistry (Cary Institute), and global modeling (NCAR).  This training is followed by discussion groups on particular biogeochemical processes with an explicit inclusion of multiple scales. Workshops will provide training in science communication, mentoring, and other professional development skills, with multi-pronged efforts to recruit and retain women and underrepresented minorities.  Broader Impacts: The project is enriched with a global perspective through collaboration with four international institutions: the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Germany; the University of São Paulo, (Brazil); the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Bangor, Wales; and the University of Essex (UK).  Together, these partnerships and training activities will provide the next generation of graduate students with the ability to address the biogeochemical drivers of and responses to climate change.

This is a major and long-term commitment. ""Clean energy"" encompasses a broad suite of technological approaches in combination with relentless progress towards greater efficiency in our entire system of energy use, from the sources to the social and economic end products. However, the transition to clean energy is not an issue that can simply be addressed by technological advances. Since conventional fuels will remain accessible, the transition to clean energy will only take place if consumers demand clean energy and the business, policy and regulatory environments facilitate the adoption of new approaches over the business-as-usual strategy of combustion. Such a change can only be driven by an energy literate citizenry that understands adopting clean energy is a cornerstone of building a secure future for our nation. Clean energy education is therefore an enabling component of this generational effort, one that will require the highest levels of American expertise and innovation. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will host a workshop that is intended to catalyze the formation of clean energy education programs nationwide. This workshop will bring together government leaders, industry representatives, academic experts, teachers and workforce trainers to chart the way forward to a national program in clean energy education. The workshop will provide a forum for federal agency and industry thought leaders to share their vision for a clean energy economy with academic institutions, outlining challenges, knowledge gaps, and educational needs. This knowledge is fundamental to the development of a national framework for clean energy education, whose goal is to enhance our human capital, a key to innovation and global competitiveness. This workshop will address energy education opportunities across a broad spectrum that includes K-12 schools, community colleges, universities and continuing education in the workplace. It will also foster institutional partnerships necessary to develop and sustain clean energy education programs, creating a pathway towards the goal of nationwide energy literacy.  The workshop program, presentations and related educational resources will be placed on the Internet for the public at large. In addition, a final report will be issued that contains recommendations concerning four target areas for energy education: K-12 schools; college and graduate programs; schools of business and government; workforce and continuing education.  The report will identify the greatest opportunities for, and the obstacles that might hinder the creation of, programs to reach each of these important audiences. The workshop report will inform policymakers and provide guidance for the development of a national program to prepare an energy literate citizenry.

Reverse Ecology is the application of genomic approaches to living systems to uncover the genetic bases of functional variation in nature. The revolution in high-throughput DNA sequencing and gene expression technologies redefines the notion of a ""model"" organism. Interrogation of genomes from animals, plants and microbial communities can identify genetic markers of processes at multiple scales: ecological, physiological, developmental, and transcriptional. The full interpretation of these powerful datasets demands intellectual dialogue between ecosystems ecologists, microbial geneticists, biogeochemists, and computational biologists. The program will train a cohort of Ph.D.s who can apply these technologies creatively to convert genomic and computational power into novel insights of organismal function in nature. Program highlights include 1) a year-long immersion course focused at Long Term Ecological Research sites where students design an experiment, use high-throughput genomic and computational strategies to test hypotheses and prepare multi-authored manuscripts for publication; 2) jointly mentored research rotations where students and faculty cross disciplinary boundaries; and 3) career training integrating grant writing, public speaking, ethics, diversity and international perspectives on science. This graduate program's research themes include 1) microbial and comparative genomics; 2) genetic responses to environmental stressors; 3) assembling genomes from environmental samples, and will engage IBM and the J.

Not only do these ethnic groups remain significantly under-represented at all levels in physics, but there has been essentially no improvement in their relative numbers over the past decade. PhD awards to Black, Hispanic, and Native American citizens are at 1/7th the rate of awards to white and Asian citizens relative to the size of their underlying population. There are 180 PhD programs in physics in American Universities.  If 10% of these programs were able to increase their citizen Black and Hispanic graduates by two per year this would double the annual production of minority PhDs in physics.  

The American Physical Society, working together with the larger physics community, is taking a leadership role and in activating programs to double the number of PhDs awarded to under-represented minorities (URMs) within the next decade by establishing effective and sustainable bridge programs between top research universities and institutions where undergraduate URMs are educated. There is a substantial body of knowledge that has resulted from several decades of efforts to increase the effective participation of under-represented groups (and all groups) in higher education in STEM fields.  In physics there are a growing number of physics education research groups producing important gains in understanding about undergraduates' conceptual difficulties in learning basic physics.  Because most of these groups are at major research universities, they are in a position to directly influence physics TA training, which will positively impact the instructional effectiveness in undergraduate physics courses in these institutions. 
The focus on doctoral students will have a multiplier effect on attraction and retention of under-represented minority students at the undergraduate, masters, and PhD levels. Successful doctoral students will form a cadre of leaders who can catalyze change throughout the country.  Doubling the number of PhD graduates from these groups will create a greater corps of individuals who can take on important leadership roles. 
To begin this process APS is reaching out to the students and faculty at minority-serving institutions to establish effective, personal links. It is gathering detailed data directly from these individuals to inform the larger process. Following data collection, APS will bring together leaders from top research universities committed to establishing effective bridge programs.  Existing programs and leaders within the physics community are guiding this process. Throughout this process guidance is being provided by a steering committee of knowledgeable individuals committed to improving the attraction and retention of under-represented groups in physics higher education, who have the wherewithal to move the project forward thoughtfully and deliberately. The outcome of this effort will be a set of concrete plans to establish such programs.

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award supports the development of a multidisciplinary graduate training program of education and research in food systems as they relate to poverty reduction. Most people suffering chronic extreme poverty live in rural areas in developing countries and rely heavily on food systems - the human-managed biophysical systems that regulate the production, distribution and consumption of food - as producers, consumers and/or workers. Food systems improvements have stimulated long-term improvements in human well-being yet these improvements elude people currently suffering extreme poverty.  This program provides graduate students with the conceptual and methodological tools necessary for understanding the structure and dynamics of complex systems that perpetuate extreme rural poverty. This rich understanding of the larger context into which their own disciplinary studies fit enhances students' ability to assess the implications, potential and impact of discipline-specific scientific discoveries.  A distinguishing feature of this program is that students work in interdisciplinary research teams at shared research sites in East Africa, organized around intellectually challenging, ecologically complex and socioeconomically important problems that drive extreme poverty and require broadly informed science and policies to address. The resulting training will build a diverse cadre of skilled natural and social scientists able to integrate information from diverse sub-systems to conduct scientifically sound, systems-based research to help spur the development of food system interventions and strategies that can reduce extreme poverty worldwide.

The Scripps Classroom Connection (SCC) aims to systemically and simultaneously improve communication skills of Earth Science (ES) graduate students and K-12 ES education at the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD).  These goals are relevant because earth science literacy (ESL) is fundamental to the success of our society, which must practice much more effective stewardship of our very fragile planet. Society needs to understand how planet Earth works as an integrated chemical, physical and biological system to develop appropriate strategies for sustainable use of earth resources, disposal of waste products, effective mitigation of the impact of climate change, and natural disasters. Yet ES is amongst the most neglected STEM education disciplines. 

The SCC is based on a close collaboration between Scripps Institution of Oceanography, a world-class research institute in Earth and ocean science, and the SDUSD, the 8th largest urban school district in the US, with the guidance of professionals from the UCSD education science department.  Key efforts and outcomes of our project will include: (1) Development of an enduring, pedagogically robust curriculum in ES at the SDUSD through a collaboration between scientists, teacher-educators, teachers and graduate students; (2) Training of a new breed of graduate students that is equally comfortable communicating their science to their specialist peers and to lay audiences, (3) Effectively raising ESL in SDUSD schools laying a foundation for a public that becomes an effective steward of Planet Earth.

This project proposes to strengthen the national network of partnerships and resource sharing for the NSF?s Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) through the services of the Institute for Broadening Participation (IBP). IBP will serve as a hub for a wide variety of services specifically oriented toward the goal of creating a truly national network of AGEP institutions. This project will maximize connectivity at multiple levels within the AGEP community. IBP is a small, coordinating organization which has worked with the Division of Graduate Education at NSF for the past four years. IBP has developed an implementation model for supporting a national network in an effort to increase the number of underrepresented minorities and women in STEM fields. An extensive infrastructure has been built for gathering, storing and exchanging information between programs, potential students, minority serving institutions and organizations and student mentors, with a resulting increase in the number of students who successfully navigate the transition from their undergraduate programs to graduate school. IBP has also begun developing an infrastructure to assist graduate students in the next steps in their career paths, post doctoral opportunities, faculty and other positions. This new national model demonstrates how educational initiatives designed to achieve significant cultural and structural change can be implemented by a small staff dedicated to the overall objective of broadening participation in STEM. IBP is now positioned to assist AGEP in strengthening and extending its national network of program leaders, students, potential students, and student mentors. An enhanced national network will increase the visibility and capabilities of this effort, attract entry level scientists to STEM careers, and produce a diverse new cadre of scientists and leaders for the public and private sectors by increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in the academy. 

Intellectual Merit
By dedicating a small staff to these goals, IBP has been able to develop an innovative and comprehensive approach for addressing underrepresentation in all contexts. By researching the issue, identifying problems, and posing, testing, and refining solutions, IBP has made significant progress in developing tools and methods to reduce barriers for students from less advantaged backgrounds, to cross the technology divide and to make information accessible to students who may have fewer resources. This IBP approach and the related tools created and disseminated will make an important contribution to producing a diverse STEM workforce bringing a wide variety of talent and perspectives to these fields. 

Broader Impact
IBP?s work is geared toward two broad impacts. First, increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in AGEP programs will contribute to the creation of a STEM workforce which is as diverse and inclusive with respect to social makeup. Second, IBP?s comprehensive approach can serve as a model for adaptation by any regional or national program that seeks to diversify and increase their human resource pipeline.

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program in Applied Biodiversity Science (ABS) at Texas A&M University will achieve integration between biodiversity research and on-the-ground conservation. Three pillars support the program: 1) integrated research in social and biological sciences; 2) cross-disciplinary research and collaboration with conservation institutions and actors in the field; and 3) application of conservation theory to practice. Research teams of faculty mentors and students, in collaboration with international partners, will develop complementary dissertations related to two research themes: A) Ecological Functions and Biodiversity; and B) Communities and Governance. Research will be conducted in four regions in the Western Hemisphere: 1) USA and Mexico (transboundary); 2) Mesoamerica; 3) Western Amazon; and 4) Gran Chaco. The ABS-IGERT team consists of 20 professors from ten departments in five colleges, with an extensive network of international collaborators and former students working in conservation in each of the four study regions. Points of integration in the learning path include new courses in Applied Biodiversity Science, an Amazon Field School, Cross-cultural Leadership Training, and required internships at national and international institutions practicing biodiversity conservation. Complementary dissertation research will enable students to work together within and across study regions, collating theory and results to generate practical solutions to complex conservation problems. Graduates will be prepared to face the multidimensional challenges of global biodiversity loss and will emerge qualified to assume directorships and academic appointments. By producing scientists equipped to confront transboundary issues and the international biodiversity crisis, significant benefits will accrue to academic, NGO, and government agencies. The ABS-IGERT will lead to greater involvement of underrepresented groups in Applied Biodiversity Sciences; help build local capacity in the U.S.A. and Latin America; and directly contribute to biodiversity conservation.

It is designed to prepare the next generation of graduate students for the challenges of an increasingly interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research and development arena.  The research and education activities of this IGERT program are unified by the study of structure/property relations in the increasingly important class of materials that have properties dominated by critical length scales that lie between those of bulk materials and molecular species.  Three established research thrusts are aimed at developing and understanding such materials:  (1) the synthesis and properties of nanolaminates and functionally graded materials; (2) the preparation and study of electronic and optical meso- and nano- structures; and (3) the design and investigation of molecularly engineered assemblies and materials.  Each of these on-going research topics provides outstanding opportunities for interdisciplinary graduate training because the chemistry, physics, and engineering of short length scale systems are closely intertwined. A diverse group of students and scientists from the University of Oregon, Oregon State University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Portland State University and a range of other industrial and academic partners are brought together in an effort to enhance graduate training and materials research.  Five key program elements interspersed in the graduate program are designed to accelerate the transition from student to scientist.  These include summer immersion programs, laboratory rotations in chemistry and physics at the participating institutions, a Technology Entrepreneur Fellows program teaming IGERT trainees with MBA and law students, regular research thrust seminars, and internships in industry, academia, or a national laboratory.  These program elements are designed to accelerate the transition from passive learner to scientist by training students in group-based problem solving, helping students acquire technical and time management skills and challenging them to complete a project related to a research thrust area.  The program elements described above are expected to decrease time to degree, expand research opportunities through collaborations with the participating institutions, and enhance recruitment of excellent students including members of groups underrepresented in science and engineering. The connections established by the program will have a substantial impact on the Pacific Northwest region in particular, through the education of a workforce commensurate with its large concentration of high-technology industry. The research and education collaborations formed will strengthen the scientific basis to build nanoscience infrastructure accessible to academic and industrial partners within the framework of the statewide Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute.

Fuel cells have the potential of becoming one of the key solutions to meeting our energy requirements over the next century. These high-efficiency and environmentally friendly power generators are being developed for transportation, stationary, and portable applications, but to fully realize their potential, the interrelated issues of reliability, performance, durability, and cost must be addressed. In this program graduate students will be educated to do just that. The intellectual merit and research focus for this IGERT program is fuel cell manufacturing, materials development, and modeling for design, manufacturing, and operation. Because innovation, small companies, and entrepreneurial activities have been drivers of job growth, the educational focus is on the development of Ph.D. students with both depth and breadth so that the students can operate effectively in interdisciplinary research, development, and commercial situations. The skills to be learned can be applied to any position or product, whether in industry, universities, or government labs. Faculty from six academic units (in engineering, science, and business) will educate Ph.D. students to become next-generation thinkers through education and training in four interrelated skill sets: 1) knowledge and learning; 2) communication; 3) teamwork and professionalism; and 4) innovation and entrepreneurship. The program will involve disciplinary courses and research, new courses in fuel cell systems, entrepreneurship training, internships at domestic and international locations, rotations through labs in synergistic disciplines, seminars and workshops that address fuel cell technology, leadership, teamwork, and ethics, and student presentations on campus and at professional meetings. The broader impacts include the potential societal benefit of reduction of cost in fuel cells, and broadening participation in this research area through a partnership with the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future.

The target of this research is to develop compact SAW filters using phononic crystals (PCs) for the state-of-the-art wireless systems in the GHz frequency regime. The PC structures developed in this research will be fabricated on semiconducting substrates to facilitate dense integration. To achieve this goal, we propose a combined theoretical and experimental effort in PCs including the following high-level research tasks: 1) The development of fast and efficient three-dimensional analysis tools to carefully investigate the fundamental properties of PC structures, 2) The development of a systematic method for dispersion engineering in PC waveguides and cavities and combining these devices to design and optimize SAW filters, 3) The development of an optimum procedure for fabricating PC structures for operation in GHz frequency range, 4) The development of accurate characterization tools for experimental measurement of PC SAW filters. Within the three year period of this research, we will optimize, fabricate, and demonstrate the fundamental building blocks for such filters, i.e., demonstrate PCs with phononic bandgap, optimal PC waveguides, and optimal PC cavities. We will also investigate the optimization of coupling between PC waveguides and cavities to form simple SAW filters.
 

Broader Impact: PC structures as defined in this proposal have the prospect of creating a revolution in on-chip filtering for wireless systems. In addition to traditional filtering, the technology could pave the way towards new types of filters such as a single-chip channelizer whereby different frequency bands are routed to different output filters within a very small device footprint. Once the fundamentals are understood, we have the prospect of creating adaptive filters for software-defined radio. 

Two graduate and several undergraduate students as well as an outstanding high school students will be trained. Providing K-12 and minority students and high school teachers with the opportunity of learning some basics of wireless SAW devices as well as improvement of an existing graduate level course on ""Acoustic Devices and Materials"" involving teachers are other aspects of this proposal.

The program integrates research, training, and educational activities among complementary faculty in ecology, evolution and environment, infectious disease, and social science, ethics, law and economics. The goal of the program is to train a new generation of Ph.D. scientists capable of designing and implementing sound scientific solutions to environmental problems within the framework of human culture, economics, policy, and law.  Human practices and activities affecting environmental and global health have interrelated causes and feedbacks.  These feedbacks are both biological and social, and exacerbate environmental degradation and the spread of invasive species and disease.  Consequently, solutions to increasingly linked environmental and health problems require the coordinated interaction of biological and social scientists with expertise in ecology, evolution, infectious disease, anthropology, ethics, law, policy, and economics.  The intellectual merit of this IGERT consists of the integration of the research and education activities of  life and social scientists at the University of Notre Dame in a concerted effort to understand and find solutions to five specific problems: (1) invasive species in the Great Lake and their cascading effects on ecosystems (2) interactions of human land-use change and malaria transmission in West Africa; (3) cross-primate exchange of disease on the island of Bali, (4) resurgence of schistosomiasis in China driven by changes in water- and land-use patterns, and (5) impacts of invasive Sudden Oak Death as it spreads across the U.S.  Without interdisciplinary thinking, relatively simple and effective measures to reduce environmental damage and disease transmission can go unrecognized. Most analyses suffer from concentrating on only one aspect of the question (e.g., ecology, culture, or disease).  This IGERT will foster cross-disciplinary conversation and guide research directed at developing prevention and control responses to invasive species and disease that are scientifically sound, culturally acceptable, and cost-effective. The IGERT will use a coordinated set of approaches ranging from team-based research projects to outreach service activities to provide students with the interdisciplinary skills and knowledge they need to tackle the increasingly complex environmental and global health problems of our nation and the planet.

Acknowledging that there is great variation in reproductive trajectories both within and among populations, the current study examines at what point during development these reproductive trajectories are established and what external factors shape them.  Given recent evidence that early development can have profound and irreversible effects on adult anatomy and physiology, the general hypothesis is that reproductive trajectories may be initiated in childhood, or even prenatal life.  More specifically, it is hypothesized that a number of factors, from age at reproductive maturation to menstrual regularity are influenced by prenatal and early postnatal growth rates.  Most importantly, this study examines variation in adult gonadal steroid hormone levels, predicting that these profiles have strong developmental components.
This two part project will use longitudinal data from Norway to address these hypotheses.  The first part will focus on the relationships among perinatal growth, childhood development, reproductive trajectories, and ovarian function in a group of cycling women. A second, corresponding study will examine early growth, reproductive history, and testicular function in a cohort of men.  It is predicted that in both sexes, size at birth and postnatal growth will be related to adult reproductive hormone profiles and reproductive histories. 
Both portions of this project will be extensions of ongoing epidemiological studies. For each female subject, an ovarian steroid profile has already been created based on radioimmunoassay (RIA) of saliva samples collected every day for an entire menstrual cycle.  Gonadotropin levels and testosterone levels (in male subjects) have been measured in serum samples. Subjects of both sexes have previously filled out extensive questionnaires on health and lifestyle, which will be supplemented, in the current study, by ancillary interviews on living conditions during childhood and reproductive history.  The birth and childhood growth records of all subjects will be obtained through national registries and/or the subjects themselves. 
From the perspective of reproductive ecology and physical anthropology, a greater understanding of the long-lasting effects of early life events may help to further explain the broad range of human variation and the remarkable plasticity humans show in response to both short-term and long-term changes in the environment.   The current study also has obvious clinical and epidemiological implications, including the potential impact of early growth on fecundity and reproductive cancer risks.  Not only will this study promote graduate training and research but it will foster international and interdisciplinary collaboration with researchers at the University of Tromso, Norway.  The results of this project will be published in peer-reviewed anthropological and epidemiological journals in order to disseminate the findings and their potential implications to a wider audience.

However, at the doctoral level, nowhere are the reasons for international collaboration made explicit.  The educational and pedagogical goals and the anticipated outcomes are not identified in detail.  Moreover, international collaboration is costly in terms of time and money.  Is it worth the effort?  This proposed research seeks to answer that question.

In recent years innovative doctoral programs such as the NSF's Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program and the German Research Foundation (DFG) Graduiertenkolleg (Research Training Groups, hereafter abbreviated as GK) program have sought to generate a new breed of scientists.  However, there are no clearly defined criteria for success of international collaboration in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields at the graduate level.  A means of evaluation is needed by organizations such as NSF and DFG.  The purpose of this study is two fold: (1) to develop an evaluation design that identifies, analyzes, and assesses the international component of innovative doctoral education programs in the US and Germany; and (2) to undertake a formative evaluation of the past and upcoming year of two pairs of doctoral programs that are presently collaborating with each other in these countries.  This study is unique because it emphasizes the international collaboration component of novel doctoral programs, rather interdisciplinarity itself.  However, its findings will be valuable to the ongoing research on interdisciplinarity.

The proposed study seeks funding for the first phase of a five-year research project that involves two US IGERT and two German GK programs.  The outcomes of the proposed study (Phase 1) will be:  
Evaluation model for assessing international component of innovative doctoral programs
Evaluation tools (i.e., survey instrument, interview protocols, focus group protocols, etc.) to be used and tested during phases 2 and 3
Assessment of international collaboration activities (i.e., joint international workshops, international research visits, and lectures) 

Intellectual Merit 
Funding organizations, administrators, faculty, and students need a means to evaluate the success of international collaborations at the doctoral level.  In order to establish valid criteria for success we need to collect data on explicit expectations for these collaborations as well as on the successful collaborative activities and processes.  From the collected data and information criteria for success will be extracted in a deductive manner. The intellectual merit of this proposal is the development and testing of these criteria.  In addition, this study provides an ongoing evaluation that will enable direct feedback both to doctoral students as they enter scientific work in a world where global thinking and global contacts are increasingly important, and to faculty as they try to develop dynamic international collaborations that aides their research and their teaching.
Broader Impacts 
The need to move doctoral education in the direction of greater international collaboration is generated by increasing globalization. Globalization will continue to have significant impacts on doctoral education as students continue to cross national borders to gain research skills and establish international research agendas for their careers. More and more doctoral programs (beyond the NSF IGERT and German GK programs) will need to evaluate their international programs to determine whether they measure up to the new challenges that come with globalization. They will need a means to measure success."

The investigator will conduct case studies of five doctoral programs, a survey, and indepth interviews with students and faculty.
	No research has systematically and broadly examined the experiences of underrepresented groups in doctoral mathematical sciences.  By looking at this question through both the institutional and individual perspectives, this project expects to increase understanding of what it takes to succeed in doctoral mathematics, the obstacles faced by women and students from underrepresented groups, and the actions some programs have taken to help students succeed.
The research and educational activities are guided by theory that learning is comprised of three parts: acquiring knowledge, engaging in practices, and developing a research identity.  The investigator has first-hand knowledge of doctoral mathematical sciences, through her experiences as a graduate student in mathematics and statistics and her previous research on doctoral student attrition.  
The researcher has developed a network of mathematicians who do related work, who have agreed to make resources available for this project (such as access to populations of students in mathematics).  Experts in research methodology, diversity issues in mathematics, post-graduate mathematics education, online surveys, and assessment have agreed to be available to this project as advisors or as consultants.   The investigator has experience with both qualitative and quantitative research methods, and has managed complex, long-term projects through her prior work in research and industry.
  
Both the research and educational plan are focused on issues of diversity in mathematics education.  One explicit goal of the research project will be to develop concrete recommendations that mathematics faculty and policymakers can follow to increase the diversity of doctoral students who enroll in and graduate from doctoral mathematics programs.  Results will be disseminated within the mathematics community.  The investigator has begun working in this regard, through conference presentations and the development of publications suitable for a mathematical audience. The persistence framework described in the proposal, the quantitative persistence measures developed through the project, and the research findings, may well inform efforts in other STEM disciplines to recruit and retain a more diverse student body. If this research is successful, then it will increase our understanding of the factors important in the success of women and students underrepresented in STEM, the obstacles faced by some groups of students, and what faculty and other interested parties can do to improve the participation and success of these students.
 
The investigator's educational work will include training pre-service secondary teachers to be more aware of and responsive to diversity issues, leading them to teach in ways that engage children of all backgrounds in mathematics and mathematical thinking.  In addition, the investigator will be a leader in a project to develop a mentored learning community for undergraduates in mathematics, with a goal of attracting more students, and in particular a more diverse population of students, into mathematics and mathematics-related disciplines.  Through each of these efforts, the investigator aims to lead future cohorts of undergraduate students to an improved sense of what mathematics is and how it can be used, and to help them discover the excitement and value of mathematics.

able to confront a complex set of social, political, technical, and health issues within a global 
setting.  There are many issues associated with globalization and doctoral education such as the 
ways in which technology enables a new level of international research and policy networks, the 
renewed interest in and commitment to understanding the changing labor market for highly 
educated professionals, and the production of PhD recipients as they represent the leading labor 
force for knowledge-based economies. Taken together these issues create a powerful motivation 
to share information about how to educate these new leaders. 
 
To facilitate the understanding of forces and forms that shape doctoral education worldwide and 
interpret the emerging trends, the Center for Innovation and Research in Graduate Education 
proposes to bring together no more than thirty key players (policy makers, graduate education 
researchers, university administrators, industry representatives, and funders) from around the 
world in a three-day conference. Issues to be discussed include, needs of a highly educated labor 
forced for the 21st century, and the characteristics of this labor force, the impact of technology on 
research and education, the content and the pedagogy of doctoral education, the transition from 
doctoral education or postdoctoral appointment to stable employment, the changing 
demographics of the doctoral student body (i.e., gender, socio-economic class, race, and 
ethnicity), and financing graduate education, including the privatization of education throughout 
the world. Differences and commonalities among nations will be explicitly mapped out. 
 
We will commission a paper from each participating country describing the current state of 
doctoral education according to a common set of issues. The initial goal of these papers will be to 
create a common language and understanding of each country.s system of doctoral education. On 
this basis potential shared forces that drive doctoral education can be identified and categorized. 
And, the group will work together to investigate if the various reforms in doctoral education are 
converging toward a similar model as a result of global forces. 
 
Broader Impacts: This series of conferences will have a number of important impacts. First, it 
will move a broad coalition of scholars, policy makers, funders, and administrators toward a 
better grasp of the issues of doctoral education across nations. Second, it will share among 
participants information on innovations and best practices currently shaping doctoral programs. 
Third, it will work toward establishing greater inclusiveness within in the realm of doctoral 
education of underrepresented groups. Fourth, it will work to develop of a comprehensive 
research agenda on doctoral education internationally. And, fourth, it will examine ways in which 
issues can be addressed in policy to foster the education and training of leadership for a 
knowledge-based society in a global economy. 
 
Intellectual Merits: The intellectual merits of this series of conferences will include (1) 
furthering the research and training opportunities and international collaboration in doctoral 
education; (2) establishing an ongoing formal network of key players in doctoral education so that 
forces  (political, economic, technological) can be responded to in a manner most conducive to 
furthering the high quality and inclusiveness of doctoral education worldwide; and (3) providing

Oxidation processes occur within both synthetic macromolecules and biological systems, offering a common theoretical base.  Oxygen-centered  radicals  are  implicated  as  intermediates  in  key  chemical  and  biological  processes  such  as  lipid oxidation, cellular aging and product deterioration, as well as certain enzyme-mediated processes. The profound irony underlying all oxidation chemistry is that, in general terms at least, the same element that nature uses to sustain and  regenerate  life  also  plays  a  role  in  aging,  disease,  and  death.  Oxidative  stress  is  implicated  in many  chronic diseases,  including  cancer,  diabetes,  obesity  and  the  compromise  of  immune  function.    These  chronic  diseases contribute significantly to the projected $1.6 trillion in health care costs at the national level in 2003, costing 15% of

The  research  efforts will  include  basic  through  applied  research  in  four  areas:  1)  Fundamental  investigations  of oxygen-centered free radical mechanisms; 2) Oxidation in bio-derived monomers and macromolecular synthesis; 3) Oxidation  control mechanisms  in  complex matrices;  and  4)  Oxidation  processes  in  human  and  animal  aging  and disease.  
 
The goals of the program are to: 1) Expand fundamental understanding and scientific vision of the macromolecule-biomolecule  interface;  2)  Develop  creative  and  analytical  thinking;  3)  Integrate  advanced  research  training with ethics education; 4) Develop practical skills in communications; 5) Enhance teamwork and develop leadership; 5) Promote diversity in culture and worldview; 6) Construct new avenues for community outreach; and 8) Create novel mechanisms  to  attract  academically  gifted  students  to  graduate  school.  In  order  to  be awarded  a MILES  program certificate,  students  will  be  required  to  submit  an  electronic  portfolio  that  documents  successful  completion  of required elements and optional selections that meet both the program goals and the individualized interests of the student.    Unique  outreach  programs  incorporate  partnerships with  the  Science  Museum  of  Western  Virginia,  the Collaborative Laboratory with historically black colleges, and domestic and international industry internships.

To date, however, these efforts have not assessed I3 programs in terms of both program processes and program outcomes as they relate to changes in and effects on student and faculty learning, academic identity, career trajectory, and institutional mentality. To this end, this project, which is itself interdisciplinary and integrative, is both a formative and a summative evaluation of the organization, functioning, and performance of I3 programs. By exploring how, why, and in what context I3 programs lead to new individual, professional, and institutional practices, this study accumulates knowledge about how specific I3 programs develop, adapt, and perform under varied conditions, as well as collects information about the generalizable purpose, the intrinsic value, and essential components of such programs. The former knowledge will be used to design new and/or improve existing I3 programs, whereas the latter information will enhance current or future I3 evaluations. 
Given (a) the unique goals and objectives of I3 programs as compared to more traditional graduate education and training programs and (b) the paucity of knowledge and information related to I3 program processes let alone outcomes, it is critical that the empirical research be conducted in order to acquire the right knowledge and information from which to develop the proper theoretical framework and design the best practical methods for evaluating I3 programs. Thus, this study is a two-stage evaluation - exploratory evaluation research (stage 1) followed by evaluation practice design and development (stage 2). In stage 1, the study develops a theoretically informed but empirically grounded understanding of: (a) the skills, attributes, and attitudes that scientists and engineers need to succeed in the new modes of knowledge production and the new positions of scientific employment; (b) the strategies, structures and experiences that could successfully develop these skills, attributes, and attitudes; and (c) indicators for measuring programmatic success with the implementation of relevant practices, processes and outcomes. This framework is then applied to a sample of 30 I3 programs (and 60 non-I3 programs for purposes of comparison) to analyze the conditions and processes likely to influence these individual outcomes as well as broader professional and institutional developments. The combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques applied to this sample of I3 and non-I3 programs during stage 1 will produce a set of definitions, features, and metrics of I3 program ""success"" from which an evaluation framework based on valid and relevant questions, variables, and indicators will be developed and disseminated for use by others in stage 2 of the study.

A proposed Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) initiative involving Michigan Technological University and Southern University at Baton Rouge addresses this concern by establishing a multidisciplinary, inter-institutional doctoral education program directed at Achieving Environmental, Industrial, and Societal Sustainability via the Sustainable Futures Model. 

The mission of the Sustainable Futures IGERT is to educate/train and involve graduate students in the development of knowledge, methods, and tools that promote and enable sustainability in terms of society, environment, and industrial activity.  Trained doctoral students and research products produced by the IGERT will serve as catalysts for achieving environmental, industrial, and societal sustainability, and institutionalizing sustainability as a performance measure in industry and government.

Intellectual Merit. The institutions will collaboratively complement the strengths of each other to instill in each IGERT trainee the multidisciplinary awareness to formulate valid engineering decisions and public policy opinions toward cohesive and sustainable environmental, industrial, and societal futures.  This meta-disciplinary development approach will advance the knowledge and understanding of Sustainable Futures  (directed at achieving the triple bottom line) with faculty and students participating in an innovative program to educate and train the individual to research, understand, and communicate new technology and new policy. Participants at Michigan Tech and Southern University have demonstrated continuous commitment to accomplishing these goals in their research efforts and educational experiences.

Broader Impact. Key features of the program will promote the integration of research, training, and education of IGERT trainees toward the discovery, formulation, and the social diffusion of information through effective research, dissemination, and societal institutionalization (K-gray) of the Sustainable Futures Model.  This will be accomplished through collaborative coursework, meetings, and interactive research between the two campuses.  International experiences and an internship program will offer IGERT trainees practical and diverse approaches and methodologies to facilitate knowledge growth, put into practice, and information transfer to the larger society.  The program will foster a commitment to diversity by insuring that at least one third of the participating students are from underrepresented groups including women, students of color from Southern University as well as the Mid-western states that Michigan Tech traditionally serves.  In addition, an aggressive plan will focus on attracting Native American representation from local and regional Indian Reservations near Michigan Tech.

Understanding of economic, security, environmental, and cultural implications of emerging technologies has not kept pace. Decision makers typically base strategies on unstated expectations regarding the nature and effects of technological change. Because forecasting errors are endemic, analysts often rely on implicit assumptions to reduce their vulnerability to criticism. By contrast, this program explicitly identifies areas of uncertainty about effects of emerging technologies and develops strategies to mitigate uncertainty. Scientific and policy spheres typically come together after lines of conflict are drawn. Creators of technologies focus on immediate issues of development and application, while policy analysts assess the broader implications of technological change only after controversy has flared. By contrast, this program appraises knowledge when options are greater, interests are less entrenched, and policies are not yet locked into place.  

This IGERT program trains graduate students to engage early and explicitly with the pervasive uncertainty that is often under recognized in technology assessment exercises.  It features: (1) Trainees with Complementary Expertise, including engineers from the Technology and Policy Program, social scientists from Political Science, and humanists from the Science, Technology and Society Program; (2) Integrated Curriculum with three new core courses to develop methodological and substantive competencies in evaluating economic, security, environmental, societal, and ethical consequences of technical change; (3) Multidisciplinary Panels of faculty and students to develop and test methods used in training and set student research. The panels feature retrospective analysis of past emerging technologies and prospective analysis of nanotechnologies, ubiquitous computing, and genetic engineering, with a fourth technology to be selected later; and (4) IGERT Seminars to reinforce the panels and courses with intensive interaction among trainees, faculty and staff.

Intellectual Merit:  The program seeks to generate knowledge in three domains. (1) Substantive: identify knowns and unknowns on implications of emergent technologies; and backcast to identify present actions to improve future responses, including targeting research to reduce uncertainty. (2) Procedural and institutional: identify constraints on use of emerging information on effects of current technologies; and foster adaptation to emerging information by public and private institutions. (3) Methodological: develop ways of integrating formal and qualitative methods; and for using research on past emergent technologies to improve responses to current emergent technologies.

Broader Impact: Methods and substantive findings will be distributed through graduate student placements, academic publications and conferences, and via MIT Congressional Staff Seminars on science and technology issues. In addition, government, business, and NGO participation in the project will serve to check on academic blindness, to enrich graduate education, and to engage the world beyond the academy. Senior staff from the Departments of State and Defense, EPA, the UN, Goldman Sachs, Ford Motor, AFL-CIO, and Environmental Defense have expressed interest in participating in panels and research groups.

IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future.

During our initial award, we created a program that trained some forty young scholars to understand the origins, patterns, and consequences of inequality, focusing primarily on the American experience.  For the renewal period, we seek support to deepen our work on domestic trends and complement it with more explicit and sustained attention to comparative patterns in Western Europe, where widening gaps between the top and bottom of the income distribution have developed as well.

The European experience is particularly important because it is evolving in the context of political and social institutions that are dramatically different from the U.S., often designed to protect citizens from economic insecurity, poverty, and material hardship.  Hence, while both regions experience bouts of unemployment, declining demand for low-skilled workers, and rising rates of single parenthood, the consequences are often different (in terms of poverty rates, segregation, and political participation) because of institutional variation.  The intellectual merit of this renewal lies especially in challenge that comparative analysis poses to the frameworks, methods, and findings we have developed to understand the domestic patterns of inequality.

The broader impact of the research and training we propose will be felt for years to come in the form of important new scholarship on the critical social problems that emerge out of historic levels of inequality, ranging from inequities in income and earnings, to gaps between racial groups in educational attainment and political participation, to spatial and geographic concentrations of disadvantage that affect employment, mobility, crime, health, and patterns of family formation.  These are topics of considerable importance to the society we live in, and we encourage our students and faculty to write both for the profession and for the broad public. The web site we maintain receives over 2,000 hits per month, attesting to the broader impact of the scholarship we are producing in the course of this training grant.

Twenty percent of our trainees in the first five years are minorities; over half are women.  Nearly 30% of our faculty participants are minorities.  We expect this track record will continue and that the renewal we seek will help us impact the diversity of the scientific workforce.

Educational efforts formalize interactions among programs at Georgia Tech and Emory, resulting in the integrated training of biology and engineering students to address issues at the intersection of these two disciplines.  The program includes many interlinked educational components, including the capstone Hybrid Neural Microsystems course, which combines laboratory experience, problem-based learning, and implicit mentoring.  The recruitment and retention efforts target the creation of a candidate pool of potential neuroscience and engineering students who are prepared for this program.  These efforts will focus on the recruitment of a significant population of under-represented minority students, capitalizing upon existing partnerships between Georgia Tech, Emory, and the colleges of the Atlanta University Center.

Optics is both a science and a technology, and it is inherently interdisciplinary-a fact that is well reflected by the University of Colorado's (CU's) own faculty and other researchers who span several departments and institutes.  Indeed many technical fields are increasingly dependent on optical technology for communication, measurement, entertainment, displays and production, to name a few, hence the global motivation for a multidisciplinary training program in optics.  The field of optics is furthermore a natural one for CU to cultivate.  From Bose-Einstein condensation in JILA, to the development of liquid crystal displays in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), to optical information processing in Physics, to controlled chemical reactions in Chemistry, optics permeates CU's research and technology. This strength spanning several departments has been enhanced by this coordinated effort in graduate training. The IGERT training program is designed from a bottom-up philosophy:  Give students a very solid scientific and technical training in optics and they will be well prepared for subsequent employment in a wide variety of disciplines and industries. 

OSEP takes students from three home departments, Chemistry, ECE, and Physics, and augments their traditional training with a rigorous foundation in optical science and engineering.  OSEP encompasses three major research thrusts: (1) Optical control and manipulation, which includes, for example Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) for which CU physicists (who are also participants in this proposal) were recently awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics; (2) Optical metrology, which is undergoing a technical revolution thanks to advances in ultrafast lasers on the one hand and structured optical fibers on the other; and (3) Optical processing, in which combined microwave and optical holographic techniques have led to a new paradigm for processing wireless communications, astronomical, and radar signals.  The intellectual merits of these research pursuits are reflected in the substantial impact that they have already had on the recent trends in science and engineering and more so in their potential impact on future technology.  BEC, for example, is recognized as the atom analog of the laser.  Roughly speaking we are where laser research was in the 1960's shortly after its invention, yet research within this program has already targeted integrated atom optics as a technology that can do for atom optics what integrated optical technology has already done for conventional light optics. 

OSEP seeks a broader impact with its focus on the student as national and international citizen: its goal is to provide students not only with in-depth technical training, but also to provide career awareness and a global perspective of science and society.  Their training includes three laboratory rotations, one of which must not be in their home department, and they may choose to carry out a rotation in a laboratory abroad to gain an international perspective.  Students also undergo a three-month industrial internship, which can be carried out locally, nationally or abroad.  The program includes an Industrial Advisory Board whose members interact with the students, recruit for internships and future employment, and provide feedback to the program administration.  OSEP also incorporates a weekly seminar with contributions by members of academia and industry as well as by the students themselves. Skills and technical courses are complemented by courses on ethics, communication, and business to provide a balanced training to prepare students as responsible and effective contributors to society.  OSEP prepares students exceptionally well for jobs in industry; moreover, Ph.D.s with the broad education provided by OSEP are precisely the kind of individuals we hope to see as next-generation faculty. These are the individuals that can change the culture of our universities: those who see their science as part of the greater society, who raze the walls of the ivory tower and level the barriers to interdisciplinary education.

The research component of the program will be organized around interdisciplinary groups (IRTG) comprising faculty with expertise in theoretical, computational and empirical science, who will jointly mentor graduate student fellow projects. The research areas of the initial IRTG, including areas of applications, are (i) networks (social networks, gene networks, internet, electric power grid); (ii) gene regulation (cell signaling and gene expression networks); (iii) moving machines and organisms (manual dexterity and control of locomotion); and (iv) biological pattern formation (cardiac electrophysiology).

Nonlinear science has been a role model for interdisciplinary research. Principles arising from dynamical systems theory have revealed common features in seemingly unrelated phenomena across the breadth of science and engineering.  The intellectual merit of this project lies in the extension of successful strategies employed in nonlinear dynamics to confront increasingly complex systems. A primary goal of the research is to understand how systems, especially those arising in the life sciences, can be more than the sum of their parts. For example, legged locomotion and manual dexterity will be studied through a combination of mechanical devices, observation of human and animal behavior and computer models. The broader impacts of this research will be in improving the performance of robots and the treatment of physical injuries. Another theme that will be explored is how network architecture influences dynamics of a system. The concept of small world networks, developed by the founder of this IGERT Program, Steve Strogatz and his students, has already influenced research on biological, social and communication networks. Applied to the internet, the results of this research facilitate efficient web searches. In general, the program will have broad impact in developing methods to predict the dynamics of complex systems, taking full account of underlying network structures and making extensive use of experimental data. 

The primary mechanism of the IGERT program is the engagement of Ph.D. students in nonlinear systems research early in their studies. The program involves students in the conceptual phases of research, and it encourages faculty to develop long term collaborations, stimulated by their joint mentorship of students in the IRTG. The most direct impact of the program is in training a new generation of scientists with broad interests and expertise.

In drawing faculty from City University of New York, Columbia University, New York University, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Wildlife Conservation Society, NYCEP represents a rare combination of public and private universities together with privately endowed (and publicly assisted) institutions dedicated to bringing science to the public. Our consortium links over 45 faculty whose research perspectives on human and nonhuman primates include comparative morphology, paleontology, systematics, molecular and population genetics, behavior, ecology, and conservation biology. Students take courses in all these areas, attend seminars drawing on the staff of all five institutions, and have multiple opportunities to conduct original research at field sites, laboratories, and museums. NYCEP is unique for the range and diversity of courses and research opportunities that it offers.  This IGERT award will further enhance and refocus our successful graduate training program by implementing a series of innovative educational, curricular, and research initiatives, as well as to provide support for the training of a cohort of talented graduate students who would not otherwise benefit from this integrative program.

Since 1992, we have trained 110 students (including 63 females and 15 from groups underrepresented in science) with benefit from NSF/RTG funding, and we awarded 49 Ph.D.s. Of those with direct NYCEP funding, 22 have already received Ph.D.s, and many have obtained high-profile positions in universities, zoos and industry. We will build upon these successes by increasing our emphasis on the following areas: (1) professional development through student presentations and a new course covering the ethical conduct of science, oral and written communication skills, grant application, and job search; (2) student participation in international field research on behavioral ecology, conservation and paleontology; (3) visibility and public awareness, through an annual conference to showcase NYCEP activities and improve science literacy and interest; and (4) outreach to undergraduate, especially minority, students through interaction with college science programs on our campuses and elsewhere. Each of these features will enhance both the intellectual merit and the broader impacts of our program. This IGERT grant and associated university financial aid will support over 35 new students and fund about 180 student-years of graduate education.

For many years concern focused on the land, but the degradation and vulnerability of marine ecosystems is now apparent. Identifying the magnitude and causes of environmental change is a complex task, but this alone is not enough. The environmental and socioeconomic consequences of alternative policy responses must be evaluated, and this information must be conveyed effectively to policy-makers and the public. In order to accomplish this, we propose an integrated research and training plan designed to answer the following questions for specific marine ecosystems where we have expertise: (1) How have marine ecosystems changed over time and what are the main forces influencing those dynamics? (2) How do marine ecosystems currently function and what services do they provide? (3) What are the policy options available for protecting and restoring marine biodiversity and ecosystem function? (4) What information (biological and socio-economic) is needed by decision-makers and how is it best communicated to them and to the public at large?

To meet this need, we plan a new type of graduate training whose centerpiece is a series of interdisciplinary, team-based, problem-solving experiences to foster analytical and communication skills with a global outlook. Key novel elements of this IGERT program are: an intensive introductory course in the relevant natural and social sciences (1st summer); a year-long, case-studies course Marine Science, Law and Policy in which interdisciplinary teams of students work together on marine-related problems facing society (1st academic year); a summer internship (national or international, governmental or NGO; 2nd summer); assembly of interdisciplinary teams to elaborate and coordinate research strategies for targeted ecosystems (year 2); an Informatics in Biodiversity class and workshops in ethics and communication skills (years 2 & 3); and a dissertation bridging the natural and social sciences that addresses an important marine conservation problem, with advisors from within and outside academia (years 3-5).

Intellectual Merit: The IGERT program will provide greater understanding of marine biodiversity, the threats that it faces, and provide methods to address those threats.  Its interdisciplinary structure will facilitate creation of novel links across the natural, social and informatic sciences.

Broader Impact: The primary purpose of the program is to train a new generation of students capable of confronting important societal issues with respect to the health of the world's oceans.  Specific elements include building links outside academia (nationally and internationally), increasing representation of under-represented groups, and communicating the results of investigations outside traditional academic circles.

THz research will transform future computing and communication systems while providing unprecedented opportunities for biomedical imaging. Rensselaer researchers have played a leading role in the quest to understand the science and the use of THz radiation. In this IGERT program, physicists, computer scientists, biologists, electrical and biomedical engineers will focus on research in THz electronics, THz data transfer and networking systems, and THz spectroscopy and imaging.

In addition to the strong commitment to research, there is an equal dedication to education. Rensselaer has won numerous awards for its revolutionary studio-based approach to undergraduate education. The Institute is now adapting and extending the pedagogical principles successfully implemented under this program to doctoral education for students working at the leading edge of science and technology. The IGERT program will integrate THz materials, devices, radiation, photonics, imaging, spectroscopy, and computer algorithms for tomography into THz courses that will be taught in an interactive studio setting by interdisciplinary faculty from Rensselaer and by national and international collaborators. We will provide industrial and international internships opportunities for students. This will create an environment, in which students learn from student-to-student interactions, on-campus researchers, and our industrial and international partners, while forming a global network of collaborators and contacts. Special programs in leadership, ethics, life skills, and global citizenship will provide students with frequent opportunities to present and defend their research. Outreach programs will focus on undergraduates and K-12 students. 

The intellectual merit of this program is to produce top quality and diversified Ph.D. graduates in THz science and technology to serve the research and leadership needs of the most advanced industries, government laboratories, and academic institutions. Potential broader impacts range from computers that send messages orders of magnitude faster, to improved detection of breast and skin cancer, to security searches for weapons and toxins. We will proactively disseminate this studio model to other research universities that seek to create interdisciplinary graduate programs in emerging areas of science and technology.

The key scientific goals and intellectual merit of this IGERT program address three important themes of this field: nanostructure synthesis and processing of novel functional devices and systems, nanoscale characterization, and modeling. Each of these is designed to facilitate the integration of nanostructures into engineered systems. Students selected for this program will focus on one of five research sub-areas: nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, nanobiology, nanomagnetics, and nanomechanics. They will master core courses offered across several disciplines and multiple departments. Students will carry out their Ph.D. research under the joint supervision of two advisors from both engineering and the physical sciences, and they will receive additional practical training through cross-laboratory investigations within and outside of the labs of IGERT faculty.

A national and international internship program will contribute to the broader impacts of this program and constitute an integral part of the IGERT educational experience. Students may elect to complete their internship either in an industrial or national laboratory, or they can choose to work at institutions abroad with several of which we already have established close contacts. An array of services at the university will be utilized for the recruitment of a diverse student body, with much-anticipated success. Women and underrepresented minority groups will be recruited actively. We also plan to complement the IGERT program with the National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering (the GEM Program) and the National Physical Sciences Consortium. Role models and mentors are key to the successful recruitment and retention of women and minorities. Our strong group of faculty and industrial mentors will provide crucial guidance to our graduate fellows. Outreach programs to engage students from underrepresented groups in local high schools will be implemented. They include After-School Science Workshops and Summer High- School Internships in Nanoscience and Engineering. The faculty comprising the IGERT program are committed to leadership and participation in outreach and educational activities that will foster knowledge and appreciation of nanoscience and engineering in the community and nationally. 

UC Berkeley is in the unique position of having an unusual combination of resources committed to nanoscale science and engineering. Significantly, the Chancellor of UC Berkeley has identified nanoscience and nanoengineering as one of the top three research priorities on campus and has made an institutional commitment to focus research resources on areas that will be critical in the upcoming nanoengineering revolution. This program will find its specific intellectual merit in the establishment a new kind of graduate education at Berkeley in a research area that is unprecedented in its impact across disciplines. The interdisciplinary IGERT curriculum will allow to establish innovative educational concepts to prepare qualified graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley, for the future demands of this rapidly expanding field. This traineeship program spans nine graduate programs in three colleges, each with its own unique approaches to and robust research capabilities in nanoscale science and engineering.  The lasting impact of this project will not be limited to the scientific achievements that will make an important contribution towards the building, understanding, and controlling of engineered objects on the nanometer length scale.  Equally important will be a paradigm shift in graduate education, especially in Engineering education at Berkeley that is expected to have long-lasting impact beyond the scope of this program.

Each of these scenarios requires machines that can see and learn, and while there have been tremendous advances in computer vision and computational learning, current computer vision and learning systems for many applications (such as face recognition) are still inferior to the visual and learning capabilities of a toddler.  Meanwhile, great strides in understanding visual recognition and learning in humans have been made with psychophysical and neurophysiological experiments. The intellectual merit of this proposal is its focus on creating novel interactions between the four areas of: computer and human vision, and human and machine learning. We believe these areas are intimately intertwined, and that the synergy of their simultaneous study will lead to breakthroughs in all four domains.

Our goal in this IGERT is therefore to train a new generation of scientists and engineers who are as versed in the mathematical and physical foundations of computer vision and computational learning as they are in the biological and psychological basis of natural vision and learning.  On the one hand, students will be trained to propose a computational model for some aspect of biological vision and then design experiments (fMRI, single cell recordings, psychophysics) to validate this model.  On the other hand, they will be ready to expand the frontiers of learning theory and embed the resulting techniques in real-world machine vision applications. The broader impact of this program will be the development of a generation of scholars who will bring new tools to bear upon fundamental problems in human and computer vision, and human and machine learning.

We will develop a new curriculum that introduces new cross-disciplinary courses to complement the current offerings. In addition, students accepted to the program will go through a two-week boot camp, before classes start, where they will receive intensive training in machine learning and vision using MatLab, perceptual psychophysics, and brain imaging.  We will balance on-campus training with summer internships in industry.

Instead of relying only on clinical evaluation and general physiologic markers to detect disease and select therapy, physicians are beginning to use cellular and molecular biomarkers of disease to select and even to design the optimized therapeutic regime for an individual patient.  To achieve the promise of this approach requires tools to detect molecular and cellular markers of disease in vivo and to monitor their modulation in response to therapy.  Cellular and molecular imaging have the ability to dynamically visualize biomarkers of disease in single living cells and tissues with microscopic resolution, yielding a fundamental change in the way we diagnose disease, and select and monitor therapy.  To achieve the promise of cellular and molecular imaging requires engineers and scientists with a wide breadth of skills in imaging science, contrast agent development, and design of tools to monitor cellular and molecular-based therapeutics.  

The goal of this IGERT project is to develop an interdisciplinary graduate training program focused on cellular and molecular imaging for diagnostics and therapeutics. This interdisciplinary program builds on our existing IGERT grant in Optical Molecular Bio-Engineering. Over the last four and a half years, our team has trained students to develop and use new photonic technologies, adaptable and specific contrast agents, and computers to address both fundamental biological questions and the need for improved diagnostic imaging modalities. At the same time, the University of Texas at Austin, the UT M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and the UT Health Science Center at Houston have invested heavily in new interdisciplinary programs in Biomedical Engineering.  In this competitive renewal, we integrate these efforts, to develop a multidisciplinary training program in cellular and molecular imaging for diagnostics and therapeutics.

The clinical use of cellular and molecular imaging hinges on the availability of a cadre of professionals with inter-disciplinary training spanning imaging science, biomarkers of disease, design and use of molecular contrast agents, and the principles of cellular and molecular based therapies.  This project will develop an inter-disciplinary new pathway, which synthesizes these fields in a single graduate degree.  The degree program will incorporate four important inter-disciplinary features. (1) A doctoral portfolio program of coursework will prepare students to carry out inter-disciplinary research in this field. (2) Students will carry out inter-disciplinary research under a new advisory structure, where co-advisors from different disciplines supervise the student's research.  The thesis committee will have broad participation from faculty in the Colleges of Engineering and Natural Sciences as well a clinical mentor. (3) Students will receive training in technology assessment and transfer, to help them appreciate the spectrum of translational research as it leads to commercial products.  (4) Students will participate in at least one internship where they see the application of their research in a different setting: Clinical internships allow students to participate in translational, clinical research; industrial internships enable students to participate in technology development; and international internships enable them to carry out research and development with a global perspective.  

The intellectual merit and broader impacts of this IGERT project reside in the integration of inter-disciplinary research and education that will bring together teams of students, faculty and clinicians with diverse skill sets to develop and evaluate novel molecular and cellular imaging systems for diagnostics and therapeutics.  These teams will collaborate to develop and present courses and seminars, to define important clinical problems and to develop and evaluate engineering based solutions.  Through participation with historically minority Texas undergraduate institutions, we will recruit graduate students from underrepresesented groups to participate in this program.  As we focus on the parallel development, assessment, and transfer of technology, we will create key partnerships with industry.  These partnerships will provide our students with information about a variety of career opportunities, and will expedite the process of bringing the research advances developed here to general medical practice.

Each project has as its overall goal a better understanding of human behavior and agency in the transformation of the Earth's surface. Deforestation, agricultural extensification, land fragmentation, intensification, degradation, secondary plant succession, and urbanization are unifying themes.  The great strength and broader impacts of these projects collectively is their global reach and regional coverage. All involve collaboration with in-country scientists, who offer detailed local knowledge of field sites and data, facilitate fieldwork opportunities for trainees, and help to foster global perspectives on substantive and policy issues.  The IGERT program will increase synergies within and across projects to the direct benefit of the trainees.  

The intellectual merit of this program is that it builds on a firm base in a discipline (Ph.D.s are in a discipline or curriculum), adding coursework in complementary disciplines (population science for natural scientists; natural and spatial science for population scholars) and interdisciplinary training and research experiences.  Scientists with a strong disciplinary base but with training in multiple perspectives will be ideally placed to bridge social, natural, and spatial science in research on population-environment interactions.  The elements of the IGERT program are: a research apprenticeship on one of the population, land use, and environment projects; formal course work; participation in an ongoing interdisciplinary seminar; international field experience; and ethics training.  In addition, an internship program will be created to involve undergraduates who are members of underrepresented groups in the projects and to encourage them to pursue interests in population and environment. 

The IGERT training program will be housed at the Carolina Population Center (CPC) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH).  IGERT trainees will be provided with fully equipped offices at the CPC, where IGERT project faculty (the principal and co-investigators of the projects) maintain research offices and where the projects are staffed and based.  The IGERT program joins and extends interdisciplinary training programs at the CPC and the Curriculum in Ecology and UNC-CH.   Further, as part of the IGERT program, CPC and the Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences at Duke University will jointly sponsor a series of distinguished lectures, colloquia, and workshops.

Participants will be centered in the School of Pharmaceutical Science at the University of Mississippi and the School of Polymers and High Performance Materials at the University of Southern Mississippi.  They will be tied together through research projects, broad education in business and entrepreneurialism, and interactions with industry in the US and abroad.  Specific components of the intellectual merit include: Basic research projects coupling medicinal/pharmaceutical science and polymeric materials; Discipline-centered, interdisciplinary and entrepreneurial education involving students-teaching-students, workshops, seminars, short-courses, industrial internships and international experiences; and Continuous reinforcement of the discipline and entrepreneurial components by team-building activities, video conferencing plus joint proposals, presentations, publications and business plans.

Broader impact of this program is inherent in the materials and methods being developed, and in how the projects and business plans are implemented: Within the state, bringing together two excellent programs to teach and do research at a truly innovative and socially important science interface; Within the US, by developing a successful model for research and teaching in science that uniquely combines structured education, training and hands-on experience in business and entrepeneurialism; and World-wide, through learning from and teaching students and industrial practitioners in other countries and other disciplines.

Students experiencing this program will be able to start their own companies, perhaps even at or before graduation, and to be highly effective members of larger company research and development teams.  The methods and education materials developed will also be made available to members of the local community, industry in the state and throughout the nation, and students and faculty at universities everywhere through workshops, seminars, books and training manuals, and distance-learning courses and degrees.  It is expected that this IGERT program will serve as a model for integration of science and entrepeneurial education that have immediate and long-term impact on other programs in Mississippi, and will result in new businesses that will enhance economic development in the state and quality of life everywhere.

Globalization can be a powerful engine for international development, but in many developing countries globalization has instead meant rising poverty and inequality. Columbia has brought together a distinguished interdisciplinary social science faculty to investigate why, and to provide a deeper understanding of the impact of globalization on developing countries. Through the IGERT program, these faculty will train the next generation of researchers in new models and new methods for studying international development.

The IGERT trainees will be drawn from the departments of economics, political science, sociology, the newly created program in development studies, and from the urban planning program. The program combines a rigorous disciplinary grounding, acquired chiefly during the first two years, with an intensive and interdisciplinary training experience that includes a semester-long course in globalization taught by the PI; a two-semester interdisciplinary foundations course in international development (to be created specifically for the IGERT program); an integrated mentored team research experience; and a research internship on a faculty-led project. Columbia's program has a strong international dimension. All IGERT trainees will undertake a summer research internship abroad, accompanied by training in research ethics with a focus on international issues and by intensive language training as needed. The program also includes funding for symposia and smaller-scale dialogues that will attract international researchers and policymakers. Through this curriculum, the trainees will gain a firm disciplinary grounding along with an understanding of key concepts and approaches of the other disciplines. This interdisciplinary fluency will permit more effective cross-disciplinary collaboration as well as innovation through the appropriation of ideas and tools across disciplinary boundaries.

The intellectual merit of the IGERT program is in the commitment to bring new disciplinary and cross-disciplinary perspectives and tools to bear on the problem of globalization and international development. To better understand the implications of globalization for economic development, models are needed that systematically incorporate the social and political institutions, rule of law, transparency, and other factors that can modify or enhance the impact of markets, as well as the geographic and environmental factors that can shape the course of development. This research will necessarily be more analytically complex, modeling interdependence among countries and regions and examining the pacing and sequencing of development. The program will have significant broader impacts of two main kinds. First, it will develop new graduate curricula in globalization and development, including course syllabi, that will be available to other institutions through the program website. Second, it will disseminate research by IGERT faculty and student trainees to scholars and policymakers via major symposia on international development as well as smaller-scale dialogues.

Informatics - which includes modeling, data analysis, interpretation, and management of information using computerized systems; combined with ecosystem science; and study of the biotic (living) and abiotic (nonliving) components of complex systems and their interactions - contributes to basic theory as well as natural resource policy and management.  Practically every government agency, national and international organization involved in natural resources and ecosystem management is engaged in Ecosystem Informatics.  The field is timely, participating scientists are successfully collaborating across these disciplines, and the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. has many pertinent issues and agencies.

Intellectual merit: The goals of the Ecosystem Informatics IGERT program are to: (1) train young scientists who will make basic contributions to ecosystem science, computer science, and mathematics; (2) promote discovery through team-based research and education; and (3) further ecosystem and natural resources management and policy. This IGERT enhances current efforts in eco-informatics, many involving NSF-sponsored efforts (e.g. LTER, NCEAS, SDSC). This program will train scientists who can work on interdisciplinary teams, supported by internships at national and international organizations.  Research efforts integrate four ecosystem science areas of (1) diversity, stability, and invasion in communities; (2) carbon and nitrogen fluxes in watersheds and airsheds; (3) disturbance dynamics in landscapes, oceans, and coastal zones; and (4) fluxes of material and energy through physical networks, with five areas of informatics: (a) software engineering for model construction, experimentation, and replication; (b) representation and modeling of complex ecosystems; (c) information management and access; (d) spatio-temporal database systems; and (5) data mining and pattern recognition.

Broader impacts:  Ecosystem Informatics is largely missing from graduate education today.  The IGERT program will train students to become outstanding interdisciplinary scientists and effective contributors to ecosystem informatics research teams. Through cross-disciplinary team-based activities the program will improve diversity, recruitment and retention of Ph.D. students in computer science, mathematics, and ecosystem science.  It will contribute to ecosystem management and policy at the regional, national and international levels through student-faculty team projects, presentations and symposia, and internships across the US, Europe, and the Pacific Rim.

To address the complex challenges in the biological sciences in the 21st century, there is a growing need for professionals who can translate scientific problems in biology into mathematics and computations; for such productive work, familiarity with modern scientific computing approaches as well as key biological challenges is essential.

Intellectual Merit: This IGERT award is for a multidisciplinary Computational Biology (COB) doctoral program at NYU and MSSM targeting students interested in pursuing research in biology/biomedicine who require a transition from/to the mathematical/computer/physical sciences to best meet scientific challenges and career goals. This experimental, bidirectional program will offer integrative training that exploits NYU's strengths in applied mathematics, computer science, biology, and biochemistry, and Sinai's leadership in biomedicine. The major COB research themes - macromolecular modeling, computational genomics, and physiological modeling - will train students to investigate biological systems spanning wide temporal and spatial scales, from atoms and macromolecules, to cells and organs, to organisms. Modeling biological systems across such scales is essential for a modern systems biology approach aimed at understanding physiological processes and diseases and applying this knowledge to biomedicine.

To integrate training in biological and computational areas and provide trainees broad scientific perspectives and work experiences, the COB PhD program includes: (1) Dual faculty mentorship for thesis research; (2) Interdisciplinary training through flexible and background-tailored tracks in scientific computing and computational biology (courses in computer science, applied mathematics, biology, and biomedicine), trainee-led seminars, and ethics/research conduct courses, while ensuring competitive time to degree (5 years); (3) Summer internships in industry, academia, government (Agilent, IBM, Celera, Merck, Novasite and 3D Pharmaceuticals, supercomputing centers), or international laboratories; (4) Learning environments and activities that promote interdisciplinary interactions and broader collaborations within and outside NYU/MSSM, including: trainee-led COB seminars, annual COB retreat, and common COB lab/lounge; and (5) Mentoring and career development activities to ensure student retention, especially women and underrepresented groups, through student advisory committees, trainee-led support group, and partnerships with Burroughs Wellcome Fund and NYC's IGERT programs at CUNY and Columbia.  The COB doctoral program will be evaluated and evolved continuously by its executive and internal/external advisors in close collaboration with the pedagogical experts of NYU's Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE).

Broader Impacts:  COB will train math/computer science students to successfully model biological systems and, in turn, provide biology students the grounding in computational techniques so they can tailor the model and algorithms to specific biological problems. To help bridge disciplinary gaps, we will design background-tailored short (non-credit) courses before Year 1 and promote peer learning by pairing students from complementary backgrounds.  We expect that COB's activities will enable trainees to act as catalysts for novel interdisciplinary collaborations and to acquire expertise in cutting-edge research areas; these experiences will prepare them uniquely for research and education careers in academia, industry, and government. In addition, COB's program of integrating scientific grounding, experience in team-oriented multidisciplinary projects, mentoring, and career broadening activities will serve as a new model of graduate training at NYU/MSSM and beyond, promote the development of curricula for computational biology, and provide the opportunity to develop the COB doctoral degree at NYU based on the new model. Recognizing the urgent need for diversity in the sciences, we will make concerted efforts in conjunction with participating departments and with successful new minority initiatives at NYU to recruit and retain the brightest students, especially women and other underrepresented groups.

GIScience is an emerging interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the nature of geographic phenomena and of geographic information, providing theoretical foundations for Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIScience seeks to formalize geographic principles using logic and mathematics, to explore scientific, educational, and policy-related uses of geographic information, and to elucidate the complex relationships that individuals and society have with GIS. It also provides a framework for scientific and engineering studies of physical and social phenomena. GIScience underpins the multi-billion dollar GIS industry in the United States, including its many applications relevant to national security and to the economy, and to science and engineering.

The scientific core of the project focuses on research in three major interlocking areas. The first research theme is basic geographic information science, which includes ontology of the geographic domain, cognitive geography and geographic cognition, human interaction with geographic information and technology, and geographic information, institutions, and society. The second research theme is geographic environmental science, which integrates spatial databases with regional models to forecast the environmental effects of phenomenon such as groundwater contamination and volcanic flows. Geographic social science is the third research theme, and is based on the integration of spatial analysis and spatial statistics with GIS, addressing topics such as the development of new methods for the detection of hot spots in patterns of phenomena such as disease or crime, and of better methods for intelligent highway systems. The educational and training aspects of the program are centered on four core courses, including a new required core course in ethics and professionalism.  Students will also be required to have competence in the use of GIS software, and a basic understanding of the mathematical foundations of the field. The program also includes cross-department research experiences, internships (including international research internships), and an international summer school. The international summer school will be open to early-career scholars in GIScience from other US institutions, broadening the impact of the IGERT-funded graduate research training beyond this institution. Over the next five years, the program will have a new funding pattern: trainees will be funded for two years as NSF Fellows, and for two years on university-based enriched assistantships. This is an important step toward institutionalization, since toward the end of this funding period we will argue for the long-term continuation of university support. Five additional years of external support will allow completion of the institutionalization of the program, producing a lasting effect on the culture of graduate education within the participating departments and beyond. 

The intellectual merit of the proposed activity lies in its attention to innovative research in environmental science, social science, information science, and engineering. The project will continue to foster interdisciplinary sharing of ideas and research methods, and continue to influence the work of both faculty and students involved in the program.  This influence will extend well into the future as the trainees enter the workforce. The broader impacts of the proposed activity will come from the integration of social and natural science research to produce policy recommendations for decision-makers. The program will develop broadly prepared Ph.D.s with multidisciplinary backgrounds who will have a significant impact on the further development of the field both nationally and internationally, in academia, government, and industry.

The program also received subsequent support from various federal agencies (ONR, ARO, AFOSR, and NASA) and industry (Boeing and Raytheon). It is a multidisciplinary program whose primary objective is to substantially increase the number of minorities, particularly, African Americans with Ph.D. degrees in Materials Science and Engineering. The IGERT project is intended to provide additional fellowships to meet the demand from students to enter the Ph.D. program. It also includes stipends for some undergraduate and Master's level students who could be appropriately prepared to enter the Ph.D. program. 

The thematic area of research is the development of structural nanocomposites. Recent studies show that an infusion of a small percentage of nanoparticles into a polymer can bring about significant changes in the chemical and mechanical properties of composite materials. To bring these benefits to structural composites, we are planning to continue a development of the science and technology of nanocomposites. A diverse team of researchers has been assembled to study the entire spectrum of technology related to synthesis, fabrication, and characterization of structural nanocomposites. The three subprojects of the proposed research theme will be: (i) Synthesis and Analysis of Structural Nanocomposites, (ii) Modeling and Manufacturing of Structural Nanocomposites, and (iii) Performance Evaluation of Structural Nanocomposites. The proposed research activities will be a systematic and logical expansion of studies of the synthesis, modeling, and manufacturing of advanced nanocomposites that are already being performed by the Tuskegee team under various research grants. 

Each subproject will consist of several student research projects. Several faculty members will be involved in each research project. A faculty member from this team will also serve as the thesis advisor to the Ph.D. student. Each project will include a Ph.D. student, a Masters student and two undergraduate students. In conducting the proposed research and educational activities, members of the Tuskegee team will collaborate with two majority universities with internationally recognized research centers in nanomaterials (Rice University and the University of Wisconsin), federal research laboratories (Air Force Research Laboratory, Army Research Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory) and industry (Boeing and Raytheon). Three new graduate level courses related to nanomaterials science and engineering and one course dealing with issues of ethics in research will be developed as part of this IGERT project. We also intend to make arrangements for the students in the Ph.D. program to intern at national and industrial laboratories to acquire additional research and professional development experience. The Ph.D. students who express a desire to join the professorate will be given opportunities to teach selected undergraduate courses and team with the faculty in teaching selected graduate courses.

The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the fact that the benefits of nanoparticle infusion into a polymer are being harnessed for the manufacture of nanophased structural composites using a comprehensive approach. These structural composites will consequently have significantly superior mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties. Fulfillment of the stated objectives will expand our knowledge of the science of nanoparticle-polymer interactions as well as provide, in the short term, comprehensive technical information on a new generation of structural materials. The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activities include production of a large number of African American graduates, including many at the Ph.D. level, in an emerging area of materials science and engineering. Such graduates should become role models for many young minority science and engineering students in years to come. Moreover, these graduates will help bring much-needed diversity to the nation's advanced technological workforce. It is also anticipated that the methodologies developed here for the manufacture of nanocomposites may well lead to patentable processes for the large-scale production of nanophased structural composites.

The focus of this IGERT is to support training and research that provides both a deep understanding of human needs and what technology can do to provide for those needs. This IGERT brings together a number of research institutes in CMU's School of Computer Science (Robotics, Human-Computer Interaction, Language Technology, and the Center for Automated Learning and Discovery) and departments within Pitt (Rehabilitation Science and Technology, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Nursing, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Bioengineering, and Communication Science and Disorders).  A key feature of this IGERT is that, after appropriate course work and training, each student will (1a) engage in a full time clinical internship program for at least one semester or summer or (1b) produce a conference quality paper describing a clinical study that student performed, and (2) produce a conference quality paper describing the design, implementation, assessment, and/or refinement of an assistive technology.  This requirement will necessarily mean that technological students have a substantial clinical experience, and clinical students have a substantial technical experience.  Additional cross-over clinical and technical experiences will be encouraged.  

The intellectual merit of the proposed activity includes getting technical and clinical departments to talk to each other, understand each other's thinking, and create a truly joint educational program.  The IGERT program ensures that students gain exposure to basic technological research as well as the translation of research to clinical applications.  Collaboration with Pitt will provide opportunities for CMU students and faculty to get exposure to real clients with real problems in real contexts, rather than the usual 2nd or 3rd hand problem descriptions isolated from context.  Collaboration with CMU will provide opportunities for Pitt students and faculty to get exposure to state of the art technology, and exposure to a wider range of students and faculty who could serve as sources of expertise and collaborators.  This IGERT will facilitate communication and understanding among rehabilitation and technology disciplines by bringing together students and faculty working on assistive technology in several different CMU institutes and departments at Pitt. Participants in this IGERT will work to develop online courses and open source software to make our learning resources accessible world wide.  

The broader impact of increased research and training in assistive technology is to improve the lives of people with disabilities, the elderly, children with developmental disorders, and ultimately help make everyone more perceptive, smarter, and more capable.  Our definition of assistive technology is quite broad, and thus we expect to have a wide impact.  There are huge needs and opportunities for assistive technology.  Each year the number and percentage of senior citizens in our society increases. Many need assistance to live independently as long as possible. Nursing-home care can be improved in many ways with assistive technology. The number of diagnoses of developmental disorders in children is increasing, and technology can assist these children to develop and participate in our society more fully. The use of technology to reduce the effect of disabilities in perception, reasoning, memory, and movement is rapidly increasing. The Americans with Disabilities Act mandates greater integration of people with disabilities. Rehabilitation engineering and assistive technology will need to play a substantial role in the order for the goal to be reached.  Central to our research and education is outreach to individuals and groups with needs or disabilities that technology can help.  Pitt's Department of Rehabilitation Science and Technology (RST) has one of the highest concentrations of people with disabilities as faculty, staff, and students of any academic program in the world.  In addition, we will model our diversity and outreach programs on the successful recruitment of women by Pitt's RST and CMU's School of Computer Science.

Emphasis will be on intellectual diversity and non-traditional pedagogies in training students across disciplinary boundaries, while deliberately enhancing connections with international and non-university partners. Workshop and seminar style learning will be employed, as well as active involvement of students in the management and implementation of the program. The intellectual foci will be the interaction of biological and physico-chemical controls on the cycling of metals and nutrients, especially terrestrial nitrogen; the role of microbiological processes in mediating biogeochemical cycling; and the effects of variation in genotype and phenotype on ecosystem functioning. Ultimately, the program will consider how complex behavior arises from the interaction of individually simple relationships in natural and managed ecosystems.

These include techniques for (a) dating archaeological and paleoecological records; (b) reconstructing past climates, plant, and animal communities; (c) locating buried and submarine sites; (d) reconstructing extinct technologies and their impacts on past environments; and (e) identifying past exchange systems by tracing inorganic materials to their geological sources.  Graduates of the IGERT program will acquire specific expertise in one or more of these areas, together with a knowledge of the broad range of archaeological sciences, plus a firm grounding in archaeological theory and techniques, blending experiences acquired in classrooms, laboratories and fieldwork. IGERT support will also provide minority undergraduate students and high school science teachers internships in archaeometric laboratories at the University, and will be paired with IGERT-supported graduate students to develop materials for school science curricula.

Biomechanics is the study of phenomena in biology that is broadly concerned with the mechanical characteristics of cells, tissues, and organs. It deals with both structural aspects - for example, the strength of the cytoskeleton and the Young's modulus of the cell - and dynamic aspects - the motion of fluids in biological microchannels and the action of biological micromotors. Understanding these phenomena and processes requires combining methods, tools, and styles of research from biological and physical sciences, and from engineering. The IGERT program is intended to offer Ph.D. students an education designed to make them proficient in the methods of both biological and physical sciences. The research component of the program will generate improved understanding of important and relatively unexplored biological processes; it will also use this understanding to design inanimate systems that mimic aspects of the biological systems (biomimetic systems). The educational component will combine thesis programs that require co-advisors from biological and physical science and engineering, research rotations through laboratories with different styles of research, and active interaction among students with different backgrounds. The program will support 10 students per year, and involve 20 faculty at Harvard in the departments of biology, chemistry, and physics, the Division of Applied Science and Engineering, and the Medical School. Many of these research groups already collaborate in other projects: the proposed program will strengthen and extend these collaborations, to the benefit of both students and faculty.

Every year these hazards cause many fatalities and injuries; major disruption in community lifelines such as power, communication and transportation; and large amounts of property damage. The events of September 11, 2001, showed us that man-made hazards are likely to be part of our lives. Since, such natural and man-made hazards are unpredictable, we can curb losses through careful planning, effective public policies, and good engineering. The objective of this IGERT program is to produce a cadre of professionals prepared for broader multidisciplinary research, comprehensive planning and balanced decision-making in the future. This objective will be met by integrating graduate research and training in a program that crosses the disciplines of atmospheric science, engineering, and economics leading to an interdisciplinary doctoral degree. The focus of the program is wind science and engineering and associated economics/risk management. Scientist and engineers at Texas Tech University have pursued wind-related research since 1970 when a devastating tornado struck near the university and destroyed much of downtown Lubbock. Over the past three decades the research program has continued to grow in the areas of building response and design, the atmospheric boundary layer and economics/risk management. With close to twenty faculty members participating in the program, a variety of research projects are in progress at a given time.  Some of the research areas are wind characteristics in tornadoes and landfalling hurricanes, post-disaster investigation of building damage and economic losses, deign criteria for shelters, full-scale building response in the field, wind tunnel studies, simulation of damage, forecast for wind power, hurricane evacuation and others. NSF IGERT Fellows will take core courses in atmospheric sciences, wind-related engineering, economic/risk management, ethics and GIS. The fellows will also be trained through a rotation of three laboratory courses in meteorological measurement, wind-related engineering experimentation and statistical analysis of random phenomena. A one-semester internship in a national laboratory, industrial organization or governmental agency is part of the program.  This training along with selected courses in a specific discipline will prepare the Fellows to pursue multidisciplinary research in wind science and engineering. The goal is to complete a Ph.D. degree in four to five years after completion of the bachelors degree.

The vision of PRIMES is to break down these boundaries through early and uninterrupted exposure to interdisciplinary research projects, via a course called Team Research in Ecology (TREE). Students will obtain the tools they need to work effectively in TREE through reciprocal course offerings among the graduate programs, through modular courses on Advanced Quantitative Methods in Ecology (AQME), and through colloquia, workshops, and conferences. Teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and internships with nearby state and federal agencies will reinforce the interdisciplinary training of PRIMES and leverage IGERT fellowships. Existing projects in quantitative ecology at CSU will shape the curriculum of PRIMES, drive the interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty members and students, and lead to topics for Ph.D. theses. Projects will be organized into five Research Focus Groups to allow sharing of resources and ideas on related problems: Ecology of Managed Ecosystems, Ecology of Global Change, Dynamics of Introduced Disease, Aquatic Resources Modeling, and Evolution in Structured Populations. The PRIMES Council, with representatives from Biology, Mathematics, Statistics, and other participating departments, as well as an external agency, will guide the program toward the goal of making PRIMES a permanent fixture in graduate education at CSU.

Abstract

This proposal is recommended for funding.  The proposal was rated as Highly Recommended (FUND) by the panel and the program director agrees with the panel's judgment.

Specific comments about the proposal in relation to the review criteria are outlined below.


Intellectual Merit

The fields of bioengineering and bioinformatics are being redefined through technological advances, but it is clear that the most critical work will take place at the interface between classical disciplines. It is therefore essential to attract new people to the field who work well in the gray areas and who can learn to adapt easily to the different languages of molecular biology, computational and mathematical sciences, and engineering.

The VCU team has developed an integrated curriculum to provide exposure and experiences in both fields of bioinformatics and bioengineering. This Institute fits into the overall goals of VCU. They have developed a new five year Master's in bioinformatics, with three tracks: computational and engineering, genomics and biology, and quantitative and statistical. Newly created School of Engineering has a strong focus in Bioengineering with connection to MCV Hospitals of VCU Health Systems. VCU Life Sciences creates an umbrella over these entities to enhance the integration of the two fields. 


Broader Impact

In order to take rising juniors with no necessary laboratory experience and evoke within them the sense that they are active and valuable members of a scientific project, the Institute will lead them through a series of highly integrated intensive research simulations, inspired by actual problems from each of their host laboratories. Core skill bases such as computational and mathematical methods will serve to integrate, across disciplines and research areas, the analytical and methodological skills of the Institute participants. While the first summer will provide students with a view of bioengineering and bioinformatics that is focused on the problems addressed by the laboratories of the institute, the second summer will offer a broader look at the fields.


I recommend funding of the proposal for a total of $660,602 for four years.

Through this approach, the IGERT project seeks to establish a new curriculum for graduate education in Biologically Inspired Materials and Materials Systems. The curriculum serves as an integration of natural science, life science, and engineering. This program will create a new graduate training program that uses biologically inspired approaches to bridge a gap in current biomedical and bioengineering programs. The Center's vision is to bring nature's engineering into the engineering curriculum and engineering principles into the study of materials, revolutionizing the way engineering and life sciences are taught at the graduate student level. Thus, this IGERT project will develop a new paradigm for education and research, using nature as an example for engineering, while explaining nature using engineering principles and rigor. This program focuses on three specific areas: (1) Bio-NanoScience and Engineering (single molecules and self-assembly), (2) Encapsulation, Coatings, and Surface Patterning (materials at the cellular scale where the lipid bilayer serves as the defining basis of all life), and (3) Hierarchical Systems (larger, more macroscopic, functional organisms). This focused approach will allow students and faculty to develop mapping concepts to the leading edge of knowledge and to explore the intellectual and practical aspects of creating a new curriculum at the interfaces of biology, medicine, engineering, and basic physical and chemical sciences. This is an initial step towards establishing a new paradigm in science and engineering education that explores life's mechanisms at the molecular level and translates these findings up through hierarchical scales of structure and organization to bring greater understanding of mechanism to the biological organism and unique designs to engineered devices.

The major challenge for biological and biomedical research for the foreseeable future is to understand how the information encoded within a genome determines the development and functioning of a living organism. To move from the level of DNA sequence to an understanding of the molecular interplay producing the final traits of an individual will require a continuum of experimental approaches ranging from experimental genomics, molecular biology, and novel biophysical methodologies, to advanced data screening schemes and computational techniques. Traditional alignments of the biologically based disciplines will be insufficient to solve the complex problems associated with functional genomics. Genome projects, regardless of the organism, will rely increasingly on the physical and computational sciences. The increased need for interdisciplinary research will require scientists trained to work interactively in multiple disciplines. This program introduces a new educational paradigm, developed to train students to move freely among the disciplines needed to investigate genome function. Students receive training in the biological, physical and computational sciences through a combination of core and advanced courses, intensive workshops, and research seminars. Emphasis is placed on a high-quality research environment and a tutorial relationship between the student and her/his mentors and program committee. Central to the students' training in interdisciplinary research will be the use of a paired mentoring system, a concept referred to as twinning. The primary mentor plays a role similar to the traditional graduate advisor and comes from the student's primary area of research. The secondary mentor comes from a second discipline, and each student develops a research project dependent upon interdisciplinary collaborations.

The proposed IGERT PhD experience is different from one in a traditional discipline, and possibly unique among CSE programs in the USA. The IGERT PhD theses will be jointly supervised, and those students with a particular disciplinary orientation will share resources, knowledge, and approaches with IGERT students with other orientations.

IGERT students and faculty will work together in three Focus Groups: Microscale Engineering, Complex Fluids, and Computational Materials Science, to solve a wide range of important and timely problems that depend deeply on integration of information from the smaller scales to the larger scales. These multiscale problems require a strong foundation in both engineering and the mathematical and computational sciences. The curriculum ensures depth in one area and a significant exposure to high level courses in one or more ancillary areas.  It includes new courses in atomic-scale computer simulation, and computing for high performance, to specifically address the multiscale nature of the Focus Group problems and their computational requirements. An internship is required to broaden and reinforce the interdisciplinary research experience, and a required series of workshops and seminars will give IGERT students a significant exposure to important aspects of career development and ethics.

At the same time, commercialization of these devices is hindered by a great need for novel molecular engineering and miniaturization techniques. Progress will require highly interdisciplinary collaboration between engineers, chemists, physicists, and biologists. Four centers at OSU have organized an inter-center IGERT program uniting the broad range of expertise necessary to foster new manufacturing technologies. These technologies will be achieved by integrating molecular self-assembly with micro/nano-manufacturing of polymeric and ceramic materials. A unifying molecular engineering protocol will be developed and applyed to the design, fabrication, and testing of devices in two major areas:  (a) polymer- and ceramic-based biomedical devices (i.e. BioMEMS), and (b) high performance ceramic sensors, sensor arrays, and membranes for transportation and environmental applications. Although a few inter-center research projects have been conducted among these four centers, they are isolated cases having limited scope. The technical breadth and complexity of this integration, to our knowledge, has not been previously attempted on this scale. A natural outgrowth will be the development of a broad-based, cross-center educational program. The vision is to integrate the latest research developments into a practical student curriculum, and to impart to doctoral students the necessary multidisciplinary skills and global awareness needed to catalyze broader impacts on society. The key elements of the inter-center education and training program include four to five new MEMD courses (multipurpose seminar course, overview course, sensor technology, nanotechnology and/or membrane science and technology); an interdisciplinary curriculum; dedicated research at two or more centers; industry internships and internships at national laboratories; travel to national and international meetings; tours and visits to research labs in the U.S. and abroad; and a web-based dissemination plan.

IGCC will use its long-established programs on all nine campuses of the University of California and institutional ties with Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories to implement this program. During the Cold War, nuclear threats drove investments and keen young minds into the study of nuclear weapons issues. Today, the incentive to become experts in nuclear matters is much reduced. Yet, the nuclear threat has not gone away. As has been underscored by the events of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath, it is time to build a new community of scholars and practitioners trained in strategic analysis, nuclear policy issues, the roles of nuclear weapons, the regional and global realities that comprise today's nuclear threats, and in traditional and prospective responses ranging from arms control to nonproliferation to counter-proliferation. The principal goals of the program are: to attract and train the next generation of strategic thinkers to address the public policy issues of tomorrow about nuclear threats; to produce new incentives for interdisciplinary research in the field of public policy and nuclear threats; to provide students with access to organizations and individuals engaged in nuclear policy development at home and abroad; to develop career opportunities at such organizations for post-doctoral employment; and, ultimately to provide the expertise the United States needs to develop sound nuclear policies in a changing international environment. Another important goal is to create an interdisciplinary and intergenerational community of scholars who can learn from one another and create synergies across disciplines that last well beyond this program. The IGERT program is designed to achieve these goals. Two groups of approximately ten UC doctoral dissertation students will be chosen by statewide competitive selection, and supported fully for five years each. IGERT Fellows will be supported for one of these years by their respective UC departments that will provide research or teaching assistantships in nuclear policy-related topics. IGCC will work with science, social science, and humanities departments to recruit new Ph.D. students for this program. Applications will be reviewed and Fellows selected by a statewide interdisciplinary subcommittee of the IGCC steering committee. IGCC, Ph.D. programs on the UC campuses, Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories, and senior mentors will team to conduct this program. Students will receive their fundamental Ph.D. education in their home departments; this education will be enhanced by a series of required IGERT training activities: a four-week summer training seminar on the historical and current security implications of nuclear weapons both globally and regionally, including their strategic and political roles, arms control, nonproliferation, missile defense, terrorism, and related technology issues; a research or teaching assistantship; two-month summer internship at Lawrence Livermore or Los Alamos National Laboratory; an overseas fellowship in Asia or Europe; a summer policy internship at a governmental or non-governmental organization in Washington, DC; and monthly interdisciplinary video-conferences focused on contemporary research issues surrounding nuclear weapons and public policy. Where appropriate and possible, additional UC students will be invited to participate in IGERT training activities.

De Gennes defines soft materials as organic media that organize on supramolecular length scales via weak associative interactions. Examples include thin polymeric films for sensors, organic blends for electronic displays, and natural and artificial tissue, spanning the range from complex fluids to soft solids. They are intrinsically multi-scale, molecular to macroscopic. A stunning variety of structures and morphologies can emerge, enabling a wide range of new technologies, and all scales impact processing and use. The Ph.D. program will be built around joint seminars, an industrial internship, collaborative thesis research, and a core of joint course offerings, including two new laboratory courses. The research will be in three complementary areas: effects of confinement on polymer statics and dynamics, chemical and physical patterning, and multi-scale phenomena in bio-related materials. The proposed core curriculum will be taken in addition to the core disciplinary requirements in the student's major department. Our proposal is consistent with existing Ph.D. requirements for all five participating departments, and does not add in any way to the degree requirements or faculty teaching loads; the soft materials courses will satisfy existing elective requirements, but will enable the students to focus these electives within a coordinated program. The proposed collaborative program is unique in two respects: First, it leverages the intellectual and material resources of two neighboring, urban, public/private institutions with complementary faculty and diverse student bodies. Second, it creates a unique, synergistic environment for research and graduate education in a niche area that is at the heart of numerous technologies essential to industries based in the greater New York regional area.

TITLE: A NIH-NSF BBSI Summer Institute in Bioformatics and Computional - Iowa State University

Abstract 

A NIH-NSF BBSI Summer Institute in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (SIBCB) is planned at Iowa State University (ISU). The faculty are 10 principal scientists with diverse areas of expertise, from computer science, mathematics, statistics, genomics, informatics, biophysics and structural biology. Summaries of recent accomplishments in genomics, methods in bioinformatics and computational biology, and applications to genetics and molecular biology will be presented in a two week intensive instructional course, including programming instruction and computer laboratory sessions. The participants will be 15 students supported by this grant and an additional group of 11 students from industrial laboratories plus two high school teachers, who will broaden the experience for the core students and provide additional funds to enhance the course. Following the course, the 15 NIH-NSF supported students will select among research projects and spend eight weeks developing their own research projects; thus the SIBCB will last 10 weeks. These projects will span the range from sequence analysis to comparative genomics to protein homology modeling to simulations of organism growth. An organized ""job fair"" will include presentations by the faculty. Immediately before embarking on their research projects, the students will receive an introduction to Bioethics. The research period will present the students with tools to comprehend
and begin significant research projects with a broad, integrated approach to complex biology.

This program will greatly expand the opportunities for minority students to conduct marine research at a graduate level while attending an HBCU. SSU and SkIO have collaborated for the past three years to develop a highly successful program in marine science for undergraduate students. The existing program includes opportunities for SSU undergraduates to complete research internships at SkIO and for SkIO faculty to teach at SSU. Both institutions have benefited greatly from this program, which was initiated with funding from NSF/HRD.  In recognition of the growth and success of the undergraduate program, the University System of Georgia (USG) approved a new M.S. degree program in marine science at SSU. USG will provide new faculty lines and funds for construction of a new building in support of this program. This award provides funding to initiate the M.S. program while additional state resources are brought on-line and while funds for graduate students are sought via traditional research awards. The program could provide an important model for successful collaborations that will increase minority participation in science. 

Joint funding for this program will be provided by NSF's IGERT program and the Office of Naval Research (ONR).

The intellectual merit of this program lies in the development of a collaborative graduate education program between an HBCU and a major marine science research institution. Such collaboration will be unique to this field and may provide a model for such efforts, both in geosciences and other scientific fields. Two important societal impacts should be realized from this award. First, a unique graduate program in marine sciences will be established and should become institutionalized within five years. Second, if this program is able to attract minority students who either would not have attended graduate school or who would have gone into other fields, it should greatly increase the number of minority students receiving Master's degrees in ocean sciences. The link to the IGERT program strengthens the possibility that ultimately these students may choose to continue in the field of geosciences for a PhD. Since the percentage of minority students who receive Master's degrees in the ""physical sciences""* is about 2.8% (NSF Publication #00-327, Table 4-6), and the number of students who receive PhD's in ocean or marine sciences is typically one or two per year (NSF Publication #00-327, Table 4-12), this program could have a very important impact on diversity of ocean sciences graduates within a five to ten year time-frame.

The intention of the project is to address one of the nation's central concerns; the ability of scientists to engage in policy-critical communication about their work; work that is critical to the health and well being of U.S. society.  Experts in communication, the rhetoric of science, instructional development, and training will work collaboratively with scientists and engineers in two areas of concern previously identified by the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy as well as others in the science community (1995);

1.	Scientists and engineers; ability to communicate among themselves interpersonally and in teams, and their ability to solve problems and work across scientific and other disciplines.
2.	Scientists and engineers; ability to communicate about science to larger audiences with an emphasis on lay and public constituencies and non-scientists.

The two challenges will be addressed by the accomplishment of two short term objectives and one long term goal:
	A first short term objective is producing curriculum recommendations for the communication training of scientists and engineers;
 	A second short term objective is developing a proposal for the National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Graduate Education to:
1.	articulate a new set of priorities and approaches to address the most effective and appropriate ways of communicating about science; and,
2.	produce and disseminate communication training resources for aspiring (graduate and post-doctoral) scientists and engineers.

A long term and perhaps some intrinsic goal is forming critical partnerships and building a foundation for future relationships between the communication discipline and scientists and engineers to work collaboratively on challenges in communicating about science

These activities will begin with a briefing meeting to be held in November 2001 at the NCA national convention.  A facilitated workshop will follow in Winter/Spring 2002 that will produce curriculum recommendations and a plan for a full grant proposal to explore possibilities for creating new communities of communication colleagues and scientists.  Following the spring workshop and within the 2002 calendar year, the full grant proposal will be submitted to NSF.  The proposal will focus on furthering the development of collaborative relationships between communication and science and developing training resources of various sorts to implement the curriculum recommendations.  The proposal will also address the dissemination of the curriculum recommendations and training resources.

Research in these emerging disciplines requires the coordinated interaction of scientists with diverse backgrounds in evolution, molecular biology, and computer science, yet current departmental boundaries at most universities do not foster interactions among these areas.  The comprehensive IGERT training plan at the University of Arizona is intended to meet these challenges.  This program includes advising, research rotations and colloquia, two novel multidisciplinary courses that engage students in hands-on problem solving, additional lecture and laboratory courses, training in ethics, a monthly discussion group, opportunities to interact with visiting scientists, bi-annual mini-symposia, opportunities to mentor undergraduates in research, and offsite internships at other academic institutions or at leading genomics companies. Finally, the training plan includes a strategy to recruit both minority undergraduate and graduate students into science, drawing on the Hispanic and Native American populations in Arizona. Some of the proposed training initiatives build on existing structures; others are entirely new.  The University of Arizona is particularly well suited for this training program because of existing strengths in evolution, functional genomics, and computation, a strong graduate program, and an institutional commitment to interdisciplinary programs.  Moreover, the individual participants in this program have a long track record of success in training students and a commitment to multidisciplinary collaborations.  The impact of the proposed training program uniting three research areas will be to equip the next generation of biologists with the tools to tackle the challenges of genome-scale research.

The overarching question our students are trained to investigate is the following: how is it possible for an agent to decide what actions to take to achieve long-term goals? We recognize that decision-making in complex environments is a sequential process, involving a series of episodes in which an agent, based on information available through its senses and stored in memory, selects the action appropriate for its goals. The problem is made difficult by perceptual uncertainty arising from sensory limitations and environmental complexity, by the challenge of sorting through the large space of actions available, and by inherent delays in feedback about the long-term consequences of actions. A wide variety of fundamental cognitive tasks can be cast as sequential decision-making problems. Understanding how such problems may be solved will be a critical component of a general theory of intelligent behavior in organisms, and will be essential for the design of truly intelligent machines. To study these problems, we adopt a comparative approach, combining insights from a range of model systems, including humans, non-human animals, robots, and intelligent software agents. This multidisciplinary framework will enable students to integrate ideas and methods from different fields that have been concerned with the study of sequential decision-making (psychology, behavioral biology, linguistics, and computer science), but that have so far remained largely separate. The training program is designed to create a new generation of scientists trained in this innovative, multidisciplinary approach. Graduate training will be focused on fundamental disciplinary education, a common set of courses focused on the sequential decision-making framework, and a strong emphasis on mentored, interdisciplinary research activities that span each student's entire graduate program.

Yet, as a result of the globalization of human commerce and travel, invasions are rapidly and profoundly changing the environment.  The effects of invasions are felt at all biological scales, from genes to ecosystems, with enormous ecological and economic consequences.  From every perspective, biological invasions epitomize the rapidly growing array of environmental challenges that no single discipline or constituency can solve individually.

In addition, the program emphasizes the global ramifications of invasions through the participation of international authorities, and provides support for international research collaborations and individual projects.  Trainees will be required to satisfy the degree requirements of the graduate group to which they are admitted, as well as the specific requirements of the IGERT program that aim to build a multidisciplinary perspective and teamwork.  Trainees supported for their dissertations must develop a project that integrates two or more of the IGERT core disciplines (life sciences, social sciences, law, humanities, and physical sciences), and have a similarly diverse guidance committee.  The formal training program begins with an integrative first-year foundation curriculum, consisting of a lecture/seminar series, discussion groups, and hands-on technical demonstrations.  This foundation program will be followed by a second-year group collaborative research project, involving trainees and faculty, that analyzes an invaded habitat or ecosystem from biological, social, historical, economic, and legal perspectives, and develops a comprehensive management plan.  This project will lead to an annual spring workshop, with participants from academia, the private and public sectors, and relevant stakeholders speaking directly to the problem addressed.  Other key elements of the training program include requirements for collaborative internships outside the university and participation in an extensive mentorship network.  This program will build multidisciplinary research teams that span the natural sciences, social sciences, engineering and humanities and that will train the next generation of environmental scientists to be conversant in the ethical, political, legal, and economic, and scientific issues pertinent to the analysis and remediation of biological invasions.

Twenty-five faculty participants in this program are drawn from three different schools: Engineering (Civil, Mechanical, Chemical, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Management of Technology), Management, and Arts and Sciences (Mathematics). The research theme consists of three inter-linked areas: (i) large systems reliability and risk, (ii) device- and component-level reliability, and (iii) uncertainty analysis methods. As engineering systems grow in size, complexity and cost, reliability and risk assessment is increasingly dependent on modeling and simulation, rather than on expensive (or impossible) traditional test-based methods. Therefore, the unique features of the research theme are: (i) development of the modeling and simulation-based methodology for reliability and risk assessment, (ii) systematic integration of models and tools across disciplines, and (iii) inclusion of economic, legal, regulatory, and social perspectives in risk assessment and management. The research projects will apply these concepts to infrastructure, environmental, network, mechanical, and electronic systems. The educational goals are to broaden the training with multidisciplinary perspectives, embed information technology, include model integration and high performance computing technologies, and increase the number and diversity of reliability and risk engineers and managers trained in the modeling and simulation methodology. A number of strategies are proposed to achieve these objectives: multidisciplinary coursework and dissertation topics, laboratory rotations, industry and government laboratory internships, seminars, workshops, case studies, training in professional communication and ethics, undergraduate and high school teacher participants, aggressive recruitment (especially among underrepresented groups), and systematic evaluation by industry, government and academia. The program will include strong participation and support from several industries, government agencies and national laboratories, through internships, workshop and seminar participation, educational and research collaboration, and advisory committee. Through these efforts, the graduate program aims to become a self-sustaining center of national and international leadership. The IGERT award will lead to 35 Ph.D.'s over 9 years, fulfilling a critical need of the American industry in this important field.

The vision of the Program is to provide the first truly multidisciplinary Ph.D. program in environmental economics, a program that does not compromise the depth of economics education nor the depth of education in a companion natural science discipline.  Most Ph.D. programs in environmental economics are either very narrowly economic in orientation or disciplinarily broad, with some strength in a variety of disciplines, including economics.  This new IGERT program seeks a third path, producing Ph.D.s who are as well trained in economics as any graduating from a good economics department but who also have Ph.D. level depth in one of four complementary fields of natural science: climate, conservation biology, hydrology and marine science.  The complementary science fields specified are not intended to be comprehensive but rather to reflect faculty strengths at UCSB.  IGERT fellowship support facilitates the additional curricular burden of significant coursework in a companion area of natural science. During the first half of their nominal five years in the Program, students acquire strength in economics and their companion natural science discipline, primarily through coursework.  As students move into the second half of their tenure in the Program, they become absorbed in research and research workshops, culminating in the writing of the dissertation.  In addition to coursework, three features of the curriculum are designed to build multidisciplinary strength: (i) research seminars in environmental policy, environmental economics, and the chosen complementary field of natural science; (ii) development of an original empirical paper as an intermediate step to the dissertation; and (iii) assisting faculty with the supervision of Masters students involved in group thesis work.  Other aspects of the program are designed to strengthen student research skills, introduce issues of ethics in research and develop skills for entering the job market. It is the goal of this IGERT Program to train the next generation of environmental economists, people who can truly bridge the gap between economics and the natural sciences that underlie environmental problems.  The program described is comprehensive, designed to turn out research leaders and innovative thinkers.  These graduates will enrich the workplace, both academic and nonacademic.

The program will involve graduate students and faculty from Engineering, Chemistry, Physics, Biological Sciences, and the Medical School at the University at Buffalo (State University of New York), from Roswell Park Cancer Institute, and from Hauptman-Woodward Medical Institute (all located in Buffalo, NY).  A cross-disciplinary curriculum will be developed that will provide Ph.D and Masters degree graduates with the ability to cross the existing boundaries between the many areas of biophotonics. This program builds upon the strengths of the Institute for Lasers, Photonics and Biophotonics (ILPB), at the University at Buffalo, which has as one of its goals to create a multidisciplinary environment using the common thread of photonics.  Moreover, this program will capitalize on recent investments in the ILPB for the development of biophotonics: equipment, laboratory space, and educational training facilities.

Urban ecology is an emerging field that addresses one of the most challenging problems humanity is facing world wide: how to manage metropolitan growth by simultaneously maximizing human wellbeing and minimizing impacts on ecosystems. These problems require interdisciplinary approaches that current disciplinary doctoral education cannot teach. The vision of this IGERT program is to change the culture of graduate education from a traditional enterprise focused on an individual's discipline to one clearly emphasizing interdisciplinary teams. This will increase student retention and prepare students for leadership within and beyond academia. Team members' dissertations will include a common, co-authored section based on a real-world research problem addressed by the team, plus an individually-written disciplinary section.  Students will be immersed immediately into interdisciplinary research questions, using real-world problems presented to them by outside clients.  Students from widely varied backgrounds will collectively analyze, evaluate, and propose strategies to address those problems. Rather than provide a set course of instruction before students begin research, the intent is to help teams decide what information and background they need as their analyses progress, then arrange for the extended faculty to provide that background (just-in-time education). The core curriculum assures that all students, regardless of the projects they work on, receive essential skills and informational training. This requires team-taught courses where Urban Ecology faculty members are in the classroom with the students at lectures and discussion sessions, and where everyone participates. The program centers on five broad research themes: (i) What socioeconomic factors drive urban development, (ii) How landscape ecology can be used to quantify urban development patterns, (iii) How urban development patterns affect biodiversity and ecosystem function, (iv) How changes in ecosystems affect human preferences and decisions, and (v) How policies influence human settlement and its effects.  By integrating research and education the IGERT program will build a theoretical framework and a series of empirical studies that increase understanding of the complex mechanisms that mediate the interactions between natural and human processes in urban ecosystems.  This will produce students experienced in solving real-world problems, improve working relationships between academia and business, regulatory, and urban communities, and strengthen the foundation of Urban Ecology as a field.

The RR&A program seeks to train Ph.D.-level scholars, policy-makers, and managers to address these questions in an integrated fashion.  The program integrates the tools and approaches of ecology, economics, anthropology, climate dynamics, and philosophy in a systems framework to understand the functioning of regional systems.  It emphasize high-latitude ecosystems, where current management issues require an application of the integrated understanding of these disciplines.  This graduate-training program will train a new generation of scientists to integrate the perspectives of natural and social sciences in addressing both the basic understanding of regional systems and the application of this understanding to management issues.  The goal is to train scientists that are well-grounded in one or more disciplines but have an understanding and research experience in a range of natural and social sciences.  The program will provide training to graduate students from the University of Alaska and students enrolled in other universities.  It provides course work and a seminar program that integrates ecology, economics, and anthropology in a systems-modeling framework and provides faculty mentorship and internships in areas outside of each student's parent discipline.  The program emphasizes cross-cultural communication through heavy involvement with the Alaskan Native American community and with managers, businesses, and conservation groups.

That these problems are important should be self-evident: electronic transactions are increasingly central to social, economic and political activity in nearly every realm of human endeavor, within and between nearly every location on the planet.  The infrastructure to support safe, meaningful, efficient, equitable and productive transactions will determine the extent to which the information revolution is socially beneficial. STIET will offer a comprehensive program from matriculation to graduation that will focus on the interaction between social and technical mechanisms in order to respond to these needs through current research and the training of a corps of scholars to carry forward teaching and research in this area. The program will: (i) provide fellowships for the first two years of graduate study; (ii) require 3 STIET core courses and 2 advanced STIET electives; (iii) provide a weekly research seminar and biannual day-long workshops; (iv) develop a multi-disciplinary, cross-school community of scholars within Michigan through collective and collaborative activities, both synchronous and asynchronous (with computer-supported community and collaboration technologies); and (v) build connections to the external multi-disciplinary research community through its Web site, conference travel, and research experiences at industrial partner facilities. When fully implemented, the program is expected to engage about 35 doctoral students at various stages of their degree.  Through the resources and activities of STIET, the students will be encouraged and supported so that they receive serious preparation for multi-disciplinary research and pursue multi-disciplinary approaches to understanding and solving important socio-technical problems in their dissertation research.  A large group of faculty are involved from several disciplines (computer science, economics, information, business, public policy) with a long-standing commitment to multi-disciplinary and collaborative research.

In marine and freshwater systems, chemical signals affect critical processes such as feeding, competition, mate recognition, habitat choice, host-symbiont and host-pathogen interactions. These chemical signals not only directly affect organisms but also produce a cascade of indirect effects on population structure, community organization, and ecosystem function. Numerous investigations indicate that chemical signals mediate many of these ecological interactions in aquatic systems, but exceedingly few investigations have coupled aquatic chemical ecology with microbiology, sensory biology, physiology, or an understanding of the fluid dynamics that mediate the transmission and reception of signals. Few scientists have the requisite breadth and cross-disciplinary training in ecology, chemistry, sensory biology, microbiology, physiology and small-scale hydrodynamics necessary to advance the field of chemical signaling in aquatic systems. The recent NSF workshop on challenges and opportunities in biological oceanography (OEUVRE) identified a mechanistic understanding of these small-scale chemically and physically mediated processes as a major challenge facing this diverse field. Georgia Institute of Technology, in collaboration with Skidaway and Scripps Institutions of Oceanography, is uniquely positioned to train students to meet these challenges. Under this IGERT program, graduate training at Georgia Tech will consist of a unique series of integrated core courses, an intensive, hands-on class in aquatic signaling where interdisciplinary student teams will experimentally investigate projects of their own design, intemships, and mentoring by a multidisciplinary graduate committee. Seminars will be conducted on biological, chemical and physical interactions affecting aquatic signaling, scientific ethics, special issues faced by under-represented groups and women in science, and the practical aspects of professional development in science and engineering. During the project, IGERT funds will support over 40 graduate students, produce about 26 PhDs, and start a permanent center for aquatic signaling at Georgia Tech.

Its objective is to communicate, rapidly and effectively, information about research-related ethical issues and decision-making across the several colleges that make up the university. The long term goal is to increase the level of ethical research behavior and decision-making within the university. The short term goals are: first, to create a group of change agents within the institution (the Research Ethics Fellows) who, along with the project team, will be able to help train others, serve as resource people for their peers, and model ethical behavior in research; second, to put in place a comprehensive and systematic approach to teaching research ethics that not only cuts across disciplines (colleges/departments) but also across levels (faculty/graduate student); and third, to implement a structural approach to research ethics training that becomes part of the institutional fabric itself. The project team is proposing a curriculum in the area of research ethics which includes a series of instructional modules. Following a baseline survey of faculty and graduate students, the modules will be presented in a workshop (with a keynote speaker), to a set of ten faculty/graduate student teams (20 Research Ethics Fellows) representing departments across the institution. The modules will subsequently be offered to the faculty, graduate students, and staff of the university community. During this same time, the Fellows will continue to meet with one another in study groups, carry out projects, and also engage in dissemination efforts within their departments and colleges. Finally, the project will sponsor a university-wide conference, again with a keynote speaker, at which the research team and the Fellows will present the results of their various projects, and share their dissemination efforts.  A follow-up survey of faculty and graduate students will also be carried out. Along with the baseline and follow-up surveys (covering knowledge, attitude, and behaviors of faculty and graduate students at WMU), evaluation will include the learning improvement and the satisfaction of all people who participate in the instructional modules. The second year will follow the same structure, with another set of ten faculty/graduate student teams from across the institution. In addition, the previous Fellows will assist the project team in presenting the instructional modules during the year and continue to participate in the study groups. Evaluation efforts will also continue. Furthermore, representatives from other post-secondary institutions in the region will be invited to attend the spring conference as part of an effort to extend the impact of the project to other institutions.

IGERT: Integrative Graduate Training in Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program of education and research in bioinformatics and functional genomics.  The program builds on four strategic initiatives: (1) A new Genomic Sciences graduate program, beginning fall 1999; (2) Genome Research Laboratory, Forest Biotechnology Laboratory, Bioinformatics Research Center and Veterinary Medicine research tower, being completed 1999 through 2004; (3) Longstanding collaborations among researchers in statistics, animal sciences, plant genetics and forestry; and (4) Alliances with industrial partners in neighboring Research Triangle Park and on the University's Centennial Campus. As part of the new curriculum, 34 IGERT trainees will take a 15-credit common core of courses, followed by specialized offerings in functional genomics or bioinformatics.  The academic program emphasizes NC State University's unique strengths in agriculture, forestry, statistics and veterinary medicine.  Trainees also will have industry internships, a joint journal club and a seminar series. Currently no national genomics center focuses on agriculture, biostatistics, veterinary medicine and forestry.  NC State University is one of a very few institutions that can bring high caliber intellectual resources to bear in these areas.  The program is designed to create a community of university and private investigators working together at the frontiers of genomic sciences research.  New medicines, agricultural products, micro-scale technologies and methods of statistical modeling and analysis are among the expected results.

IGERT: Cross-Disciplinary Training in the Neural Basis of Cognition

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a new multidisciplinary, multi-institution, graduate training program of education and research within the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.  The CNBC offers interdisciplinary training to students in a variety of fields who seek to understand how cognitive processes arise from neural mechanisms.  Participating departments at Carnegie Mellon are Computer Science, Psychology, Robotics, and Statistics.  At the University of Pittsburgh they are Mathematics, Neurobiology, Neuroscience, and Psychology.  The IGERT training program is a new kind of cross-over training experience in which students develop professional competence in an area outside their home discipline.  For example, a computer science student whose research involves computer modeling of the hippocampus could work in a neurophysiology lab, learning to do parallel multiunit recording from the hippocampus of behaving rats.  A psychology student doing functional brain imaging could receive cross-over training in statistical analysis techniques for functional imaging data.  During their first year in the IGERT program, students will acquire necessary background knowledge through a combination of coursework, directed reading, and observation in the lab.  In the second year students will work half-time in their host lab to complete a small research project of their own.

IGERT: Nanotechnology

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program of education and research
in nanotechnology.  This field draws from revolutionizing advances in science and enabling technology to build extremely small structures and devices.  Nano-scale structures are several billionth of a meter long, about a thousand times smaller than the human hair.  Expertise to build these structures is growing rapidly, and capitalizes from fundamental advances in physics, electronics, chemistry, material sciences, biology, biotechnology and medicine. This interdisciplinary approach to nanotechnology requires close cooperation among fields of science and technology that are traditionally separated.  The new graduate education program in Nanotechnology at the University of Washington will thus educate a new generation of scientists and engineers who will cross those disciplinary boundaries. Graduate students will enroll in one of the seven participating departments and become involved with the Center for Nanotechnology through additional course work, research experiences, hands-on training on modern nano-analytical tools, seminars, symposia, and social interactions.  Additional options include an industrial internship program, and various certificate programs.  The student will graduate with a Ph.D from a home department and Nanotechnology, for example in Physics and Nanotechnology.

IGERT: Teaching Craft for Macromolecular Creativity

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program of education and research on the synthesis, characterization, processing and theory of macromolecules. Students in eight departments will participate in this IGERT experiment.  After research-driven formal training in the above topical areas, the students will join an interdisciplinary team including other students, faculty and off-campus participants.  The research mix includes engineering plus curiosity-driven and applied science.  An Apprentice-Artisan-Craftsperson ladder is adapted from the trade arts to develop skills, creativity, ethics, responsibility and philosophy.  Students will arrive early for a summer of research discovery and ethics training.  Based on demonstrated merit, they will be elected to apprenticeships.  Apprentices will work side by side with professors and off-campus ""research master craftspersons"" for 2 to 6 weeks-long enough to demonstrate first-hand the responsible and ethical conduct of research, but short enough that the student can still flourish independently.  Upon completion of a written report and advancement to Ph.D. candidacy, Apprentices become Artisans.  Among other privileges and responsibilities, Artisans may write minigrants in support of original ideas.  After a successful data defense, Artisans will be declared Craftspersons and become eligible for up to six months of ""finishing school"" at another university, government or industrial site.  Excellent opportunities have been pre-arranged, but Craftspersons might design their own based on preliminary data from their independent minigrants.  The core curriculum will be revised to serve a more interdisciplinary clientele.  Team-taught, integrated lab/lectures will pay special attention to practical skills, including those required for equipment building, programming and troubleshooting.  Training in the ethical conduct of science and technology, plus business issues, will be provided in two courses available to graduate and undergraduate students across campus.  Students must perform a community service project and participate in a new, interdepartmental seminar.  A strong reward structure will maintain student and faculty interest in this demanding experiment.  The member departments and off-campus participants will share their different strengths in gender, cultural and racial diversity.  More than 30 students will participate overall.  Successful aspects of the experiment will spread throughout the campus, guided by a new sociometrics project to assess its effectiveness.

IGERT: Graduate Training Program in Carbon, Climate and Society 

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program of education and research on the carbon cycle and climate change.  We will construct and test a highly interdisciplinary educational structure designed to better train graduate students interested in human interactions with the environment.  As humans have been far more adept at causing environmental change than at understanding the impacts of those changes, we in the education arena need to quickly adapt and change how we train students, particularly graduate students, in how to effectively address and solve environmental problems. Our current disciplinary-based graduate educational structure does not effectively meet that need.  Students are not learning how to cross disciplinary boundaries, particularly across the social and natural sciences, and how to work effectively in teams.  Neither are they taught how to effectively communicate with the press and the public in order to make their research findings more broadly known and accepted.  Thus, our proposed program merges students from natural sciences, social sciences and journalism into cohorts that will focus on carbon and climate issues.  We combine formal coursework with research internships and a team based approach to problem solving in an attempt to explore new mechanisms of graduate education in environmental issues.

IGERT: Dynamics of Complex Systems in Science and Engineering

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program of education and research on the dynamics of complex systems. Nonlinear science has increasing impact on many disciplines in the natural sciences, engineering, and medicine, and requires training that bridges traditional departmental and school boundaries. This graduate training program emphasizes the unity of fundamental concepts underlying a broad range of scientific research areas: nonlinear optics, computational neuroscience, pattern formation, chaos, ergodic theory; and applications to engineering and materials science problems: interface motion, combustion, and mixing. The goal is to prepare the students for today's rapidly evolving professional environment. Students will be equipped with the tools and intuition needed to tackle complex nonlinear problems arising in various guises and technical fields. Cross-disciplinary research and communication skills will be developed through an intensive year-long course, in which small graduate-student teams will investigate a topic guided by two faculty members with complementary perspectives. This early research experience will be followed by a thesis on a different topic; in the case of IGERT fellows the thesis project will be co-advised and cross-disciplinary. Internships will provide additional training experience. Cross-departmental research seminars and student-run seminars, regional workshops, yearly retreats, and an active visitor program will foster a highly cooperative, diverse, cross-disciplinary training environment.

IGERT: Integrative Human Evolutionary Biology

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, graduate training program of education and research on human evolutionary biology. The Human Evolutionary Biology Doctoral Program (HEBDP) is a graduate program linking anthropology with molecular and organismal biology, chemistry, engineering and geology that promotes interdisciplinary research emphasizing experimental and comparative methods for studying human evolutionary history. HEBDP is a collaboration between George Washington University, Howard University, the University of Maryland, the Smithsonian Institution, and other Washington DC area researchers.  The evidence for our species' evolutionary history is well studied and of unquestionable social and scientific importance.  Yet, despite a wealth of fossil, archaeological, molecular, paleoecological and comparative data, issues as basic as hominid phylogeny, the evolution of bipedal locomotion, diet, language and cognition, and the effects of environmental change on human evolution, and vice versa, remain poorly understood.  These gaps in our knowledge partly occur because few students are trained in the new range of analytical, experimental and conceptual skills needed to test evolutionary hypotheses. HEBDP will combine coursework with innovative problem-based learning seminars, internships and research to train students in new methods for studying our species' fossil, archaeological and genetic records.  Because human evolutionary research has broad social and medical implications, HEBDP includes training in skills required for the effective public dissemination of science.

IGERT: Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training in Urban Ecology

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program of education and research in urban ecology. Urban ecology is a relatively new endeavor, thus fellows will have unparalleled opportunity to define the field with a diverse group of faculty members, students, and postdocs. Cities are not only important ecosystems to humans but are excellent laboratories for ecological research. The Central Arizona - Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research project, one of only two urban sites in the NSF's LTER network, provides an established research infrastructure for frontier, multidisciplinary research and graduate training. Training will be built on a collaborative model emphasizing cooperation and teamwork. Fellows may earn degrees in six core departments in the life, earth, and social sciences and will participate in team research, courses, and seminars that emphasize integration among disciplines. Dissertations will be integrative and multidisciplinary and will include a substantial collaborative component beyond the student's home discipline. Collectively, these activities will afford skills that should be broadly applicable to careers in public and private sectors and in academia. The main objective of the program is to educate a new kind of scientist who is broader, more flexible, more collaborative, and more adept at linking science and social issues than heretofore.

IGERT: Training Program in Bioinformatics

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program of education and research in bioinformatics.  As part of a major new bioinformatics initiative at UCLA, the IGERT bioinformatics program will provide rigorous training for Ph.D. candidates in thirteen participating departments, supporting them with tools for creating robust new bioinformatics applications.  It also will engage undergraduates from UCLA and feeder institutions in summer research internships and support accelerated bioinformatics training that can bypass the baccalaureate and proceed directly from undergraduate admittance to an advanced degree.  IGERT trainees will satisfy all major subject area requirements of their Ph.D.-granting departments and also the core components of the newly established, certificate-granting interdepartmental program in bioinformatics.  This core consists of courses in genomics and bioinformatics, statistical methods in computational biology, and a weekly seminar in which students and faculty discuss specific examples of how biological problems map to are solved by approaches from multiple disciplines.  The interdepartmental program also requires a subject area minor in molecular life science for trainees in computer science, mathematics and statistics; trainees in life sciences must satisfy a minor in mathematics-statistics or computer science.  IGERT trainees will work in matrix environments that force regular, collaborative contacts; these are provided by the Keck Foundation-supported Bioinformatics User Centers adjacent to the UCLA-DOE Macromolecular Structure Laboratories and the Human Genetics core DNA sequencing and microarray facilities. The User Centers can be made available to visitors who wish to apply powerful, integrated bioinformatics approaches in their research.  The UCLA-IGERT bioinformatics program will develop a proactive industry liaison that contributes to programmatic vision, helps test the preparedness of trainees in private sector challenges and provides networking support.  The IGERT program will also collaborate with the UCLA-based, NSF-sponsored national Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics in seminars and conferences that help define the evolution of bioinformatics as a fundamental discipline.

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program of education and research merging four existing research groups into a new entity with broad technical expertise yet still sharing a focus on Neuro-mechanical systems. Each existing group has a history of collaboration between various engineering fields and the biological sciences. However, meaningful interactions only came after considerable effort to overcome barriers. The training program will provide a formal process to help graduate students proceed through that process quickly and efficiently. Students in the training program will participate in cross-disciplinary courses and rotate through laboratories in all four fields. A multidisciplinary seminar featuring extended visits from leaders in each field will draw students together. Funds will permit travel to scientific meetings and workshops in each field. A common computer facility and office area will maintain interactions beyond the classroom. Internships in clinical and industrial settings will also be available as options. We have also planned an aggressive recruitment program emphasizing institutions committed to training students in underrepresented groups. Our trainees will graduate with appropriate tools and background necessary to work efficiently in teams. We believe that such an experience will pay great dividends to both the students and the disciplines in which they choose to work.

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program in education and research at the interface of materials science and environmental science.  Nanophases, small particles with very high surface areas, occur ubiquitously and interact strongly with living matter.  The underlying characterization and fundamental science of nanomaterials is similar wherever such particles occur.  The NEAT program will educate students in four interrelated areas: the fundamental science and technology of nanophases, the transport and transformation of nanophases in the environment, the interaction of nanophases with the biosphere, and the policy issues raised by nanoparticles in the environment.  Students will come from backgrounds as diverse as solid state physics, geology, and microbiology.  A set of courses, lab rotations, internships, and research opportunities will educate these students broadly in more than one discipline.  With the California State College system, the community colleges, and other educational institutions, we will recruit students from a wide range of cultural and economic backgrounds.   The demographics of the State of California, and of the Central Valley agricultural area in particular, provides a rich pool of potential applicants from underrepresented groups.  We will build strong interactions with Livermore and Sandia National Laboratories, the U. S. Geological Survey, and industrial partners.

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program of education and research
in computational molecular biology. Due to advances in molecular biology over the past fifteen years, biological questions can now be approached at new levels of complexity. Rather than dissecting individual components of a biological system, system-wide analytical approaches can be pursued. A critical factor in this paradigm shift has been the availability of vast amounts of genomic sequence and expression data. Iowa State University will establish a Computational Molecular Biology Training Group to provide graduate students with the necessary skills to explore complex biological questions. This group will be composed of 25 investigators with diverse areas of expertise, including evolutionary, molecular and structural biology, computer science, mathematics and statistics. Students will be trained to discern biological information from genome sequence and expression data and will focus on four interrelated areas of research: genomics, bioinformatics, genome evolution, and macromolecular structure and function. By infusing training in the biological sciences with the analytic perspective of mathematics and computer science, Iowa State University will create an exciting learning environment in which to prepare students for the challenges and opportunities presented by the post-genomics era.

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program of education and research in a new paradigm of graduate education: Problem-Centered training, delimited not by the boundaries of an academic discipline, but by the demands of solving a problem. Students are trained in a broad range of research methods derived from a diverse set of traditional disciplines. The general problem targeted by this IGERT program is: ""How does the brain achieve its function?"" The program focuses on one particularly important cognitive function: language. Basic research on language has long-term implications for diagnosis and treatment of language-related neurological and learning disorders, for literacy and language education, and for digital language technologies. The computational framework of cognitive science allows the problem to be formulated more precisely: What are the representational structures, processing algorithms, and learning algorithms underlying our linguistic abilities? How are these representations and algorithms realized in the brain? Studying with internationally recognized leaders at Johns Hopkins, IGERT trainees acquire both theoretical and empirical sophistication through a uniquely multidisciplinary range of research methods: (i) computational and mathematical modeling of language processing and learning, including symbolic methods and neural networks, in a range of linguistic formalisms; (ii) psychological experimentation on adult and infant language processing and learning; (iii) neuroimaging of brain activity during language processing; (iv) grammatical analysis of the language of adults, children, and second-language learners; (v) neuropsychology of language deficits from acquired and developmental neurological damage; and (vi) computational methods of automatic speech and language processing.

The vision is to prepare Ph.D.'s capable of being global industrial or academic leaders in manufacturing logistics.  Manufacturing logistics refers to the planning, coordination and service functions required between the point where customer demands are determined and where they are fulfilled. The increasing international scope of these functions has created a need for broader-based research and education. This requires the integration of operations research, information technology, environmental sciences, and global logistics. Clear research guidelines are provided by a NSF workshop held at Lehigh in 1997. Program goals include achievement of multidisciplinary research proficiency, industry internships, international experiences, and leadership skills.  Thirty-six participants from various universities and industry will work together to achieve these goals.

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program of education and research at Princeton to provide the next generation of computer scientists and users of high-performance computing with integrated graduate training across disciplinary boundaries. On one hand, dramatic advances in computer technology are poised to revolutionize computational science as an equal partner of theory and experiment, but their nature is such that harnessing them will require cross-disciplinary fertilization and expertise in both application areas and computer science. At the same time, advances in computer science will increasingly be driven by knowledge of applications, both scientific simulations and others. The PICAS program will address the entire computational and information pipeline in a variety of areas, from models and methods through parallel algorithms and systems to immersive visualization and information management. It will train a new breed of researchers to cross-disciplinary boundaries, develop new areas between disciplines, and exploit synergies. Centered around the computer science department, the program will include many departments throughout the university. Program components include curriculum development, cross-department advising, integrated research across disciplines, cross-cutting annual thematic programs to focus collaboration, and activities like a recent interdisciplinary seminar series that attracts many researchers from various local institutions.

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program in education and research in the field of evolutionary developmental biology. A major goal of biology is to understand the mechanisms responsible for the origin of biodiversity. A significant impediment to resolving these issues is the historical fractionation of the life sciences -- the lack of an integrated understanding of the mechanisms by which organisms obtain their form during development and by which morphological diversification originates via population-genetic mechanisms. To overcome these intellectual barriers, we are initiating an interdisciplinary training program focused on the evolution of development, to our knowledge the first of its kind. Novel aspects of our training activities include the establishment of: 1) a collaborative research-based program linking training in developmental and evolutionary biology, with a strong emphasis on genomics; 2) a formal graduate course in the evolution of development; 3) a unique dual-mentoring system involving a distinguished set of faculty in developmental and evolutionary biology; 4) an annual program of events focused on specialized areas in evolutionary developmental biology; and 5) a funding program that facilitates the involvement of minorities and off-campus students. Establishment of this program, combined with an anticipated state-funded initiative, should help define the University of Oregon as an international center in the emerging field of evolutionary developmental biology.

This has resulted in a unified perspective on groups, organizations, institutions and societies as intelligent adaptive agents composed of networks of socially-embedded, intelligent and adaptive agents that can be reasoned about, and supported by, computationally and socially sophisticated models and agents. The CASOS program will prepare students for this field by teaching them how to use computers to understand the complexities of human behavior and how to use knowledge of humans as social actors to improve computational agents. Program features include: integrated social and computer science curriculum; studio courses emphasizing real-world corporate concerns, model design, implementation and validation; mentoring program; research practicum, proposal competition; distance learning; and integrated summer workshop and conference. Classes and research will take place in the classroom/office of the future -- a distributed intelligent space where people have ubiquitous access to and can provide/receive information wherever, whenever and to/from whomever they want in an unbounded network of agents (human, webbots, robots, corporations, etc.); thus, reducing classroom/research barriers, enabling real-time computational analysis, data collection, and model validation, and increasing interaction with faculty and students at other institutions.

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program at Penn State University in biogeochemical research and education. Microorganisms control the earth's environment through an astonishing array of chemical processes.  The presence of atmospheric O2, the acidification of mine-waste waters, and element cycling in soils and sediments are all products of these tiny chemical reactors.  Yet, geochemists often ignore biotic processes in the environment because of ignorance of biological systems. Possibly more than 99% of microbes on earth remain uncharacterized, perhaps because microbiologists often use geochemically unrealistic culturing media.  Unfortunately, few scientists are prepared to address biogeochemical questions due to cross-disciplinary differences in vocabulary, technique and scientific paradigm.  Thus biologists, geochemists and engineers each bring a narrow view to the study of environmental systems even though new techniques create great opportunities for advancement.  Superbly endowed with analytical and biological facilities, Penn State will address this problem by hosting a program that includes interdisciplinary graduate-student teams for research and cross-disciplinary course instruction, a Research Colloquium and student ""charge cards"" for access to analytical services.  Students will work within a team with advisors from two disciplines and will continue with funded biogeochemical research following IGERT support.  With the time and resources provided by IGERT, approximately 31 young scientists will employ modern analytical geochemistry and biogeochemistry to explore the interdisciplinary frontier.

This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of an multidisciplinary, interregional graduate training program of education and research at the University of Alabama-Tuscaloosa and the University of New Mexico. The program will provide opportunities for students to study attributes of aquatic ecosystems in separate geographical regions that are at similar latitudes, but that have very different climatic conditions. These ecosystems both exemplify and magnify the pressing need for interdisciplinary collaborations in the context of contemporary problems confronting fresh waters worldwide. Faculty at both institutions have parallel interests in key disciplines of freshwater ecology, hydrology, and geochemistry that are essential for effective understanding and management of aquatic ecosystems. The new education/training program will include novel components that strengthen student disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and practical problem-solving expertise as well as ensure responsible science conduct, team-building and communication skills through inter-institutional education, and inter-site comparative projects. Internships with state/federal agencies such as the Bosque Improvement Group in New Mexico and the South Florida Water Management District will provide opportunities for students to apply fundamental research to practical problem-solving. The training program also is deeply committed to participation of a truly diverse student group that includes students from locally large populations of underrepresented minorities such as Hispanic, African-American, and Native American students. We envision developing graduate education that is genuinely multidisciplinary, inter-institutional, comparative across regions, and that links fundamental science with applications.

Funding is sought for a multidisciplinary program which will train a new generation of scholars in the study of social and economic inequality and the public policies which may influence it. Inequality -now at its highest level since the end of World War II --is perhaps one of the most important problems facing the United States today, yet no university offers an organized program of study which provides the interdisciplinary training needed to address its complexities. The proposed program focuses on six constituent features of inequality: work, wages and the marketplace; neighborhoods and spatial segregation; family structure and parental roles; immigration, race and labor market segregation; educational access; and social and economic policy.

Students admitted into Ph.D. programs in economics, political science, public policy, or sociology would be eligible. Those accepted would participate in the following core activities in addition to meeting the requirements of their home doctoral programs: (1) Three semester Interdisciplinary Proseminar in Inequality and Social Policy, (2) Field Specialization, (3) Qualifying Paper on Inequality, (4) Research Apprenticeship, (5) Summer Research Fellowships, (6) Advanced Research Seminar on Inequality, (7) Summer Institute on Inequality, (8) Galbraith Scholars program for undergraduates, and (9) National Fellows program.

It emphasizes the dynamic aspects of economic and demographic behavior, but its content is broad, including sociological and psychological measures.  As of 1995, the PSID had collected information about more than 40,000 individuals spanning as much as 28 years of their lives. In the last five years, the PSID added enormously to the stock of knowledge about important areas such as health and wealth; added detailed information on the residential areas in which respondents live, on mortality, and on relationships among family members; and increased the accessibility of the data to users.  The purpose of this grant is to transform this unique and premier social science data resource into a ""steady state"" panel representing the full U.S. population in perpetuity.  A steady state panel is one designed to be self-regenerating, and so will greatly facilitate the study of the evolving income, assets, and well-being of American families over their life-cycle and, intergenerationally, that of their children.  The PSID will also through supplements collect information that will increase its use in the future for:   intergenerational studies;   savings, technology and capital formation;  health and aging; child development; and  immigration.    Most data panels are what can be called ""transient"" panels.  A particular population is identified. An initial sample is drawn and an initial set of measurements collected, possibly including retrospective histories.  The sample is followed for some specified or even indefinite length of time, so long as attrition, in combination with recontact efforts, and mortality permit.  The panel is transient in that no plans are made to add new members of the same population at a future time.  A steady-state panel has some mechanism or mechanisms designed to regenerate samples o f the same (or related) population at a later point in time.  In the PSID, built-in mechanisms for regeneration include adding children born to sample parents as sample members in their own right and following splitoffs.  But these mechanisms increased the sample size and the cost of the PSID and they do not capture the changes in the character of the U.S. population caused by the larger influx of immigrants since the start of the PSID in 1968.  The PSID will be transformed into a ""steady state"" panel that would remain about the same size, attain and maintain long-term national representation (inclusive of new entrants), and prove less costly to run through the following changes:  1.  Add a refresher sample of post-1968 immigrants to ensure that the PSID is representative of U.S. households in 1997.  The immigrants would be added in proportion to their approximate representation in the U.S. population that year.  Based upon the 1997 core sample size, this means adding about 750 immigrant households.  2.  Delete the nonsample respondents currently followed (about 122), and extreme low weight cases (about 200).  3.  Identify a longer periodicity group of 2,939 original 1968 families and related recontacts to suspend in 1997 and interview in 1999 with non-NSF funding.  4.  Interview the remaining 5,929 core sample families, plus 750 immigrants and 300 recontracts, and their splitoffs, every other year, that is, in 3 of the 5 years: 1997, 1999, and 2001.  5.  Conduct additional recontact efforts and follow the successful recontacted respondents so as to balance attrition in each of the survey years.  6.  Continue Internet development for timely user access to the data.  ??"

Signaling often involves multiple levels of response, from  organ, tissue and cell interactions to events at the level of membranes, cytoplasm and gene  expression.  In our view, the most informative analyses of signal transduction involve  multidisciplinary approaches where the signal is characterized through its multiple levels and  forms of expression (genetic, biochemical, physical, physiological, etc.)  We propose to establish  a graduate training program with innovations in our instructional approach and research guidance  with faculty from six (6) departments to pursue collaborative research across multiple levels of  signal transduction.  Toward this goal, we will develop a problem-based learning course to  explore multiple facets of plant signal transduction.  Graduate students will engage in  multidisciplinary research by attacking research problems at the interface of two (or more)  research efforts.  An annual Distinguished Investigator seminar/workshop series and concluding  international symposium will provide additional opportunity for student development.  Our  program will enrich the background and ""tool-kit"" available to the next generation, as well as  the current generation, of researchers to investigate the mechanisms by which plants develop and  react to their environment."
